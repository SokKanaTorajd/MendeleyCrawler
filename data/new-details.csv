This article examines the impact of blockchain technology in agriculture and food supply chain, presents existing ongoing projects and initiatives, and discusses overall implications, challenges and potential, with a critical view over the maturity of these projects. Our findings indicate that blockchain is a promising technology towards a transparent supply chain of food, with many ongoing initiatives in various food products and food-related issues, but many barriers and challenges still exist, which hinder its wider popularity among farmers and systems. These challenges involve technical aspects, education, policies and regulatory frameworks."

This is adding pressure on the agriculture supply chain demanding it to be more productive and efficient. Adapting to technology to improve the agriculture supply chain have been identified as one solution. As the rest of the world is moving towards digital transformation, agriculture supply chains should follow the suite in order to meet the current challenges they face. This article reviews the literature on technology and technology applications in the agriculture supply chain. This article has identified the technological applications that have been built with respect to agricultural processes. Among them, it has found that, IoT as the technology which was based on many technology applications developed within the past few years. Further, this highlights IoT, Big Data and Blockchain as true enablers for the transformation of the agriculture supply chain to a digital agriculture supply chain."

Organizational culture must have strong liaison with the goals of organizations because it has direct association with organizational performance. Therefore, the core objective of this study was to investigate the influence of supply chain cultural capabilities on the performance of Thai SMEs with the mediation role of supply chain technology adoption. To achieve the objective of this study, the data was collected from the managers of SMEs by using survey questioner approach. Smart-PLS was used to test the hypotheses and analysis of data. Findings of contemporary study highlighted that supply chain cultural capabilities have significant positive influence on the performance of SMEs in Thailand. Furthermore, results indicated that supply chain technology adoption could increase the performance of organizations. Results of this research illuminated that Adaptability and consistency in organizational cultural support in the adoption of supply chain technology and supply chain technology boost up the performance of organization. This research offer new empirical indication that supply chain cultural capabilities are significant for the performance of SMEs in developing countries like Thailand. Though, this research used only cultural capabilities, the other important capabilities of supply chain such as supply chain technological capabilities, would be used in future research."

Design/methodology/approach: This research analyzed 214 survey responses from project managers who have prior experience in the field of supply chain management. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Findings: The results show that EP and SCTI positively influence SCI and SCP. The effects of EP and SCTI on SCP are found to be mediated by SCI in the context for the construction industry. Research limitations/implications: Future studies should focus on quantitative measures of SCP like budget overrun, supply chain efficiency and project success. Further research can be done through the exploration of moderating interactions of the proposed model. Practical implications: First, the study highlights the importance of SCTI. Supply chain managers should first focus on effective utilization of different technologies used to support supply chain. Second, the research gives the guidelines to the supply chain managers and project managers about the benefits of EP. They should focus on proper implementation of EP in their organizations. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature by proposing and testing the influences of EP and SCTI on SCI. This allows a strategic viewpoint when implementing SCTI, EP systems and SCI, intended to improve SCP."
