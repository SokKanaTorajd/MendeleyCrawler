Local and global government, community, and consumer pressures to meet sustainability goals prompt us to further investigate how blockchain can address and aid supply chain sustainability. Part of this critical examination is how blockchains, a potentially disruptive technology that is early in its evolution, can overcome many potential barriers. Four blockchain technology adoption barriers categories are introduced; inter-organisational, intra-organisational, technical, and external barriers. True blockchain-led transformation of business and supply chain is still in progress and in its early stages; we propose future research propositions and directions that can provide insights into overcoming barriers and adoption of blockchain technology for supply chain management."

A series of seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) were used to analyze survey data from 195 respondents. The results show that in technologically turbulent environments, the relationships between the firm's perceived usefulness and ease of use and the firm's intention to use a supply chain technology are stronger.

Rather than relying on centralized intermediaries (e.g., banks) this technology allows two parties to transact directly using duplicate, linked ledgers called blockchains. This makes transactions considerably more transparent than those provided by centralized systems. As a result, transactions are executed without relying on explicit trust [of a third party], but on the distributed trust based on the consensus of the network (i.e., other blockchain users). Applying this technology to improve supply chain transparency has many possibilities. Every product has a long and storied history. However, much of this history is presently obscured. Often, when negative practices are exposed, they quickly escalate to scandalous, and financially crippling proportions. There are many recent examples, such as the exposure of child labor upstream in the manufacturing process and the unethical use of rainforest resources. Blockchain may bring supply chain transparency to a new level, but presently academic and managerial adoption of blockchain technologies is limited by our understanding.

The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which supply chain technology moderates the relationship between supply chain strategies and performance of large-scale manufacturing firms in Kenya. Proportionate sampling was used to obtain a sample of one hundred and thirty-eight (138) from a population of six hundred and twenty-seven (627) large scale manufacturing firms. The descriptive statistics, reliability and validity tests of the constructs, correlation analysis, regression analysis and factor analysis models were used to test the hypotheses. The findings indicate that there is a strong significant relationship between supply chain technologies, supply chain strategies and firm performance, implying that both supply chain technology and supply chain strategies explain 88.2% of the changes in the firm's performance. The net effect of both supply chain strategies and technologies is explained by the coefficient of product moderating variable (SC Strategy*Technology beta = 0.532) which shows that supply chain technology is a significant moderator of the relationship between supply chain strategies and firm performance.

From there, the evolution of supply chain technology is undoubtedly tracked and the classification of supply chain technology has been clearly stated. The practical contributions of supply chain technology adoption to supply chain performance are the most excited part of this study. The result of this study could be used as a precursor to support future researchers in further investigation on this area. Thus, recommendations and suggestions for future study directions are indicated."

It has powerful information traceability function. The blockchain technology plays an important role in monitoring product quality and responding to product safety problems. Under considering the traceability awareness of consumers and the cost of using the blockchain technology, should the supply chain adopt the blockchain technology? The research on this issue deserves great attentions. In this paper, for a three-stage supply chain consisting of a supplier, a manufacturer and a retailer, we study the optimal pricing strategies of the supply chain considering the traceability awareness of consumers in two scenarios. These two scenarios are: scenario N (i.e., the supply chain does not adopt the blockchain technology) and scenario B (i.e., the supply chain adopts the blockchain technology). On this basis, we discuss the conditions that the supply chain adopts the blockchain technology by comparing the optimal profits of the supply chain and its members in two scenarios. Further, we discuss the problem of supply chain coordination when adopting the blockchain technology. The results show that it is conditional for the supply chain to adopt the blockchain technology, and the condition is related to the traceability awareness of consumers, the production costs of the supplier and manufacturer, and the cost of using the blockchain technology. We also find that under a certain condition, the revenue sharing contract can realize a Pareto improvement for the supply chain that adopts the blockchain technology."

Specifically, operational environments in developing countries constrain the supply chain technology (SCT) used by firms to manage supply chain operations. Hence, it is reasonable to conjecture that firm's operating in these types of environments might rely on and use SCT and the information they provide to manage their supply chain operations differently from firms in less constraining environments. To explore this phenomenon we conducted a grounded theory study collecting interview data from 46 logistics and supply chain managers at 16 firms across India, one of the largest and most dynamic of the developing countries. Our analysis of the data establishes that SCT constraints arise from external, internal, and relationship conditions. Emerging from the data we observed managerial emphasis on a phenomenon whereby management utilizes coping strategies to relax constraints that adversely affect their use of SCT. While our findings also revealed human intervention as a negative externality arising from the use of coping strategies, we found that management were aware of this externality and were actively addressing it as part of their efforts to relax the constraints on SCT."

Design/methodology/approach: The conceptual framework of the present study is developed by conducting an extensive literature review on blockchain technology, supply chain adaptability, alignment, agility and competitive advantage. The sample data were collected from 397 supply chain practitioners in India to validate the conceptual model. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to ascertain the validity of the measures used and a structural model was analyzed for testing the proposed conceptual framework. Findings: The results of the present study show that blockchain technology can improve supply chain adaptability, alignment, agility which lead to competitive advantage, which leads to better firm performance. Besides, trust generated through blockchain use also increases firm performance. Research limitations/implications: Currently, the respondents do not have practical experience of using blockchain technology. They have responded based on their knowledge about supply chain and blockchain which they acquired from published sources. Different supply chains require different strategic choices and different information needs. But the present study assumes that all supply chain needs are identical. The present study assumes that government regulations regarding blockchain technology are favorable; however, currently, there is no legal framework to address blockchain technology. The findings of the current study indicate that companies not only should create more awareness regarding blockchain but also should actively work with IT companies that are engaged in developing blockchain-based supply chain solution. Managers, as well as IT companies and academicians, should join hands to study and develop a framework for regulating blockchain technology and suggest these to the policy actors. Practical implications: The present study shows that supply chain practitioners are confident that blockchain technology will help improve supply chain parameters. These findings can help IT companies and their marketers for developing and promoting blockchain-based IT applications. In addition, the important implication for supply chain practitioners is that blockchain helps in creating a competitive advantage and increases firm performance. Originality/value: The effect of IT on important supply chain variables has been studied in the past; however, there is not a single study which sheds light on how disruptive technologies such as blockchain will affect supply chain adaptability, alignment, agility and firm performance."

For a closed-loop supply chain network consisting of multiple manufacturers, multiple retailers, and multiple consumer and recycling markets, we assume that retailers are responsible for the recycling of used products, manufacturers use raw materials to produce new products and recycled products for remanufacturing, and government departments subsidize all manufacturers and retailers for GSC technology investment. Then, the equilibrium conditions of manufacturers, retailers, demand markets, and recycling markets are obtained by using the variational inequality method, complementarity theorem, and Nash equilibrium theory, and the variational inequality model of the closed-loop supply chain network multiphase equilibrium is established. Based on numerical simulation, the optimal technology investment decision of green supply chain under different government subsidy rates, and the influence of market structure and enterprise cost asymmetry on the equilibrium solution of supply chain network are analyzed. The results show that government subsidies can effectively promote enterprises to upgrade their level of GSC technology investment. The intensification of enterprise competition and the asymmetry of enterprise costs will affect the composition of enterprise profits and the allocation of profits between enterprises, and the former will weaken the effect of government subsidies."

The methodology used in this research are statute approach, conceptual approach, and comparison dispute settlement among Australia and Indonesia through law case study. According to the Indonesian Law as it is stated in BW (Civil Code for Indonesia), companies can settle their loan disputes by filing a lawsuit to the district court. This method is less effective because it is time consuming and costly, while it is not worth with the nominal value of the loan which is not that much. This situation leads to a demand of a faster, simpler and low-cost solution that can be accessed online. This method is called as small claim court method. This method is considerably new and basically is a simplified procedure of the existing dispute settlement. A strong note on this method is its weakness when the disputes happen cross-border. This aspect needs to be improved in many ways considering the current method is only applicable when the parties have the same judicial territory. Hopefully, the information technology strongly supports the task of the judiciary in order to enforce law and legal justice through the application of Electronic Court (e-court) which is in line with the principle of simple, fast and low cost of justice. Vice versa, fintech lending dispute resolution requires procedural law that can compensate for the technology that is developing rapidly.

BCT promises to change the way individuals and corporations exchange value and information over the Internet, and is perfectly positioned to enable new levels of collaboration among the supply chain actors. The book reveals new opportunities stemming from the application of BCT to SCF financing solutions, particularly reverse factoring - or approved payables financing. To do so, it first identifies the principal barriers and pain points in delivering financing solutions. Then, a possible blockchain-driven supply chain model is defined. Using this framework, the book subsequently discusses relevant use cases for the technology, which could open up new opportunities in the SCF space. It demonstrates that blockchain and distributed ledgers technologies could deliver substantial benefits for all parties involved in SCF transactions, promising to expedite the processes and lower the overall costs of financing programs. Industry giants such as IBM, Maersk, China-based Dianrong and FnConn (a Foxconn subsidiary) are currently working to digitize the global, cross-border supply chain using blockchain technology, and will likely soon create blockchain platforms for supply chain finance. These solutions aim to reduce complexity and make data sharing more secure, accurate and efficient.

The distributor has access to private market demand information and decides whether to share information with the manufacturer. We investigate three kinds of remanufacturing scenarios, namely (1) the manufacturer taking the responsibility for remanufacturing, (2) the manufacturer licensing the distributor to undertake remanufacturing, (3) the manufacturer licensing the third party to conduct remanufacturing. We adopt Stackelberg game to obtain equilibrium decisions of each remanufacturing scenario with/without information sharing. We show that, regardless of whether technology licensing exists in remanufacturing models, information sharing always results in a profit increase to the manufacturer and the third party, whilst a profit loss to the distributor. Such profit loss of the distributor can be effectively reduced with the introduction of technology licensing in each remanufacturing model. As for the remanufacturing choice, if the distributor/the third-party saving unit cost is high enough, the manufacturer would prefer distributor/third-party remanufacturing mode with information sharing instead of manufacturer-remanufacturing mode as he could share more remanufacturing benefits by charging a licensing fee from the distributor/the third party. Our study extends and complements prior research that has only examined remanufacturing mode combined with either technology licensing or information sharing."

Design/methodology/approach: Using an abductive research approach, a qualitative content analysis was conducted on 126 cases of firms attempting to implement a blockchain technology-enabled supply chain system (BCTeSCS). These firms spanning across multiple industries were identified using the Nexis Uni database. Findings: Findings reveal that present BCTeSCS efforts are more-oriented toward improving operational-level capabilities (information sharing and coordination capabilities) than strategic-level capabilities (integration and collaboration capabilities). These operational and strategic-level capabilities alongside BCTeSCS deliver several supply chains performance outcomes such as quality compliance and improvement, process improvement, flexibility, reduced cost and reduced process time. However, outcomes may vary by industry type based on their uncertainties. Research limitations/implications: Given the nascent state of BCT, accessibility to primary data about ongoing BCTeSCS efforts is limited. The presented framework is based on 126 cases of secondary information. Within this constraint, the paper finds scope to future empirical research by proposing a resource-based framework of BCTeSCS and related propositions. Practical implications: The results and discussion of this study serve as useful guidance for practitioners involved in BCTeSCS integrations.

The distributor has access to private market demand information and decides whether to share information with the manufacturer. We investigate three kinds of remanufacturing scenarios, namely (1) the manufacturer taking the responsibility for remanufacturing, (2) the manufacturer licensing the distributor to undertake remanufacturing, (3) the manufacturer licensing the third party to conduct remanufacturing. We adopt Stackelberg game to obtain equilibrium decisions of each remanufacturing scenario with/without information sharing. We show that, regardless of whether technology licensing exists in remanufacturing models, information sharing always results in a profit increase to the manufacturer and the third party, whilst a profit loss to the distributor. Such profit loss of the distributor can be effectively reduced with the introduction of technology licensing in each remanufacturing model. As for the remanufacturing choice, if the distributor/the third-party saving unit cost is high enough, the manufacturer would prefer distributor/third-party remanufacturing mode with information sharing instead of manufacturer-remanufacturing mode as he could share more remanufacturing benefits by charging a licensing fee from the distributor/the third party. Our study extends and complements prior research that has only examined remanufacturing mode combined with either technology licensing or information sharing."

Previous literature often cites information technology (IT) and supply chain collaboration as direct contributors to product innovation and IT as a direct enabler of supply chain collaboration. This suggests that IT could have an indirect effect on product innovation through supply chain collaboration, although this relationship has not been addressed yet. This paper aims to analyze empirically the direct impacts of IT and supply chain collaboration on incremental and radical product innovation and the indirect effect of IT on both types of product innovation through supply chain collaboration by using data collected from a sample of 200 manufacturing firms. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling was used to check the research hypotheses with a sample of 200 manufacturing companies. Findings: The results show supply chain collaboration has a positive effect on technological innovation, showing that the collaboration with external agents foster both incremental and radical innovations. Furthermore, results show that IT directly enhances both types of product innovation (incremental and radical) indirectly through supply chain collaboration. Research limitations/implications: This article supports the pursuit of open innovation that suggests the need to acquire external knowledge to be able to develop innovation projects. The use of tools that facilitate this transmission of knowledge becomes indispensable in environments in which companies must be involved in supply chains in which different external agents intervene and in which collaboration can promote the creation of synergies and superior competitive advantages. Practical implications: Innovation requires more and more the use of knowledge management practices that capture external information to be used in the creation of new products. In this case, collaboration within a supply chain facilitates incremental and radical innovations. However, to strengthen this transfer of information and the adoption of behaviors that stimulate innovation, the company must use ITs. Originality/value: This paper focus on the indirect effect of IT on product innovation through the creation of the collaborations with external agents. In spite of the importance of this relation, it has been poorly studied by previous literature. The paper’s greatest interest lies in the fact that ITs not only facilitate the transmission of knowledge but also facilitate other types of behavior among supply chain agents that invite collaboration and generate innovations."

A theoretical model and a set of 17 propositions are developed, suggesting how the use of blockchain technology in supply chains may be understood to enable or constrain supply chain management and performance. Findings: Because of its relation to supply chain visibility and traceability, blockchain technology, as portrayed in the sparse academic literature as well as the wider trade literature, is found to be able to affect almost every aspect of supply chain performance. However effects are found to be conditioned. In addition a set of potential cohesive effects of blockchain technology on supply chain management are highlighted. Research limitations/implications (if applicable): One important limitation of the present study is caused by the very early stage of this new potentially disruptive technology. Very few examples of the technology are implemented, and therefore effects are often anecdotal or at best well substantiated forecasts.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on extant literature, a hypothesized model was developed and tested using structural equation modelling (i.e. AMOS). A survey was conducted to collect data from the supply chain managers of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies (more precisely in the food and beverage sector) in Thailand. Findings: The study findings suggest that through an ongoing relationship, trust evolves and is shaped over time and can form a competitive capability that may not be easy for competitors to replicate. Both trust and technology are found to have significant impact on supply chain collaboration and on firms’ operational performances. Research limitations/implications: One of the major limitations of the study is that the data were obtained from one single economy, which restricts its generalizability across other economies. The study was a cross-sectional and descriptive sample of the FMCG industry at a given point in time. A more stringent test of the relationships between trust, technology, supply chain collaboration and operational performance requires an in-depth case study or longitudinal study. Practical implications: The findings will enable supply chain managers in the FMCG industry to understand the strategic role of trust and technology in building supply chain collaboration that leads to superior operational performance. Originality/value: The paper clearly confirms that trust and technological capabilities are significantly associated with supply chain collaboration and operational performance. Most of the earlier supply chain collaboration research streams are based on developed economies where supply chain collaboration challenges are predictable, while the current study conducted is based on a developing economy setting. This study facilitates the author’s understanding of the challenges in managing supply chain collaboration within a developing economy."

The R&D is conducted by the CM and the OEM agrees to pay a share of the cost. At the R&D stage, we assume that there are some uncertainties both in terms of performance of the developed technology and market uncertainties. These uncertainties are resolved in the sales stage, as technology matures and information about consumers’ preferences become available. Further, the OEM can license the technology to a third party and share the revenues with the CM. We characterize equilibrium pricing and licensing strategies in two scenarios, namely, the licensing decision is made before or after the uncertainties are resolved. A comparison of the two equilibria indicates that the OEM is indifferent between making the licensing decision in the first or the second stage in most cases. But when the market potential, competition intensity, royalty rate and revenue sharing rate are moderate, there exists a small region in the parameter space where the OEM prefers to make the licensing decision in Stage 2. Interestingly, we obtain that for a large region of the parameter space, the two partners have the same preferences in terms of licensing. It is also found that different probability distribution of stochastic technology efficiency results in different licensing strategies."

The information exchanged between companies has always being a concern when having in mind trust, speed, and safety. During few decades, EDI (electronic data exchange) was the main technology supply chain professionals used to send and receive information. Recently, with the rise of the fourth industrial revolution and the Internet of Things (IoT), many aspects of the business environment have changed. Individuals and organizations are required to be more productive. One of the mainstreams for the business environment is blockchain. Some researches argued that bitcoin is the pioneer of blockchain technology. Financial companies joined forces to build a technological infrastructure to use the cryptocurrency on the market. The first blockchain conceived in 2008, in the wake of the global financial crisis and it has never been hacked. Supply chains are complex networks of distant, separate entities that exchange goods, payments, and data across a dynamic, continuously evolving landscape. Blockchain technology allows visibility providing the customer the opportunity to understand how the supply chain works and how to get more information about products traceability. However, there are some challenges to implement blockchain in logistic and supply chain. The paper presents a theoretical review including the principles of the blockchain operations and the required infrastructure to implement it.

Information is crucial to supply chain performance because it provides the foundation on which supply chain processes execute transactions and managers make decisions. Without information, a manager cannot know what customers want, how much inventory is in stock, and when more product should be produced or shipped. In short, information provides supply chain visibility, allowing managers to make decisions to improve the supply chain's performance.

Finally, the mean-CVaR-based revenue-sharing contract is used to coordinate the supply chain and profit distribution. The research shows that, under the condition of decentralized decision-making, when the retailer’s optimal order quantity is low, it is an increasing function of the weighted proportion and the risk aversion degree, while, when the retailer’s optimal order quantity is high, it is an increasing function of the weighted proportion, and has nothing to do with the risk aversion degree. The manufacturer’s blockchain technology application degree is a reduction function of the weighted proportion. When the retailer’s order quantity is low, the manufacturer’s blockchain technology application degree is a decreasing function of risk aversion, while, when the retailer’s order quantity is high, the manufacturer’s blockchain technology application is independent of risk aversion. The profit of the supply chain system under centralized decision-making is higher than that of decentralized decision-making. The revenue sharing contract can achieve the coordination of the supply chain to the level of centralized decision-making. Through blockchain technology, transaction costs among members of the supply chain can be reduced, information sharing can be realized, and the benefits of the supply chain can be improved.

We propose how the blockchain technology can be applied to facilitate the implementation of mean-variance risk analysis for global supply chain operations. We then highlight several promising areas for further studies. A future research agenda is developed."

Different licensing methods significantly impact a supply chain member's production and collection decisions, and they also have influential effects on reverse channel performance. However, there is scant literature investigating the decision on technology licensing and its impact on a supply chain member's production and collection decisions. To address this gap, we consider a manufacturer, as the patent holder, who produces new and remanufactured products and, simultaneously, he and a remanufacturer (as the licensee, who by law can only produce remanufactured products) competitively collects used products from the market in a two-period closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). We investigate two licensing patterns, fixed fee versus royalty, within the CLSC in a Cournot duopoly model. We find that royalty licensing is dominated by fixed fee licensing from the viewpoints of both the consumer surplus and environmental protection. Our result also shows that the manufacturer's optimal licensing strategy is determined by a threshold of the fixed fee: when the fixed fee is below a threshold, it is better for the manufacturer to use a royalty licensing, whereas fixed-fee licensing should be used when the fixed fee is higher than a threshold."

Product technology transfer is a key activity in the complex process of new product development and is the fundamental link in the technology supply chain. Product technology transfer too often is dealt with in an ad-hoc fashion. Purposeful- management of the product technology transfer process leads to more effective transfers in terms of timeliness, cost, functional performance, and competence building. Better management of product technology transfer gives firms access to a greater variety of new technology options, improves a firm's ability to offer significantly differentiated products, deepens the firm's competitive competencies, and positively influences sustained product development success. The central objective of this article is to gain insight into product technology transfer so that companies can manage this process more successfully and so that researchers can investigate this critical activity further. This article describes the technology supply chain as a unique form of a supply chain that poses a set of managerial challenges and requirements distinguishing it from the more traditional component supply chain. Because a single product technology transfer project is the fundamental piece in the technology supply chain, understanding this piece well is key to leveraging the extended technology supply chain and to improving overall product development performance. This article integrates literatures on new product development, supply chain management, and technology management and builds on organizational theory to present a conceptual model of determinants of product technology transfer success. The core proposition is that product technology transfer effectiveness is greatest when companies carefully match (or ""fit"") the type of technology to be transferred (the ""technology uncertainty"") with the type of relationship between the technology supplier and recipient (the ""interorganizational interaction""). A quite detailed framework characterizing technology uncertainty along the dimensions of technology novelty, complexity, and tacitness is presented to help in assessing the challenges associated with transferring a particular product technology. This article also considers detailed elements characterizing the interorganizational interactions between the technology source and recipient firms. This helps firms consider the appropriate means to facilitate the inter firm process of technology transfer. Overall, this article provides practical insight into characterizing technologies and into improving the product technology transfer process. This article also provides a strong theoretical foundation to aid future research on product technology transfer in the technology supply chain."

The hardware part consists of the embedded processor CS89712, Flash7861 memory, Ethernet, touch screen, and LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). The software system is based on asymmetric information theory design and is divided into signal acquisition, input signal detection, interference signal processing, and power signal output. The experimental results show that it is compared with the traditional supply chain information system. The designed system seamlessly integrates the hardware and software components to achieve maximum information supply in the shortest amount of time. The power supply capacity is four times that of the traditional system, and the node coverage is high. When the number of data nodes is 120, the traditional supply chain system is basically unable to supply, but the supply accuracy of the intelligent supply chain is still as high as 48%.

After adopting the QRS, sustainability issues such as greenhouse gas emission and energy waste may be more serious as production lead time is shorter. In this study, due to this dilemma, we develop a two-stage quick response supply chain with cleaner technology, where the manufacturer determines the cleaner technology investment and afterwards the retailer decides the ordering quantity. Based on Bayesian theory, we depict an information updating process for the QRS with cleaner technology. First, we find that the inventory service level significantly affects both manufacturer’s and retailer’s performance under the QRS with cleaner technology. Moreover, our analytical results indicate that the performance of centralised supply chain system is always better than the decentralised one. As a result, we propose two supply chain contracts, minimum ordering quantity (MOQ) and MOQ with buyback (MOQ-BB) to achieve supply chain coordination. Comparing with the MOQ, the MOQ-BB is more flexible to allow better allocation of the ‘additional’ expected profit between the channel members through the buyback price negotiation."

This study aims to investigate the confluence of these streams. Specifically it aims to consider the effects of retailer supply chain technology mandates on supplier financial performance. Design/methodology/approach – The design and method is a secondary data event analysis including crosssectional regression analysis. Findings – The event analysis findings indicate suppliers affected by WalMart's 2003 RFID mandate experienced net gains in abnormal stock returns. Subsequent crosssectional regression analysis show abnormal returns were stronger for suppliers with greater cash flow and for more dependent suppliers. Practical implications – Study results suggested firms with stronger cash flows are better able to absorb the unexpected costs of complying with the retailer mandate. Additionally, the findings indicate mandateassociated positive abnormal returns were more pronounced for suppliers with a larger percentage of sales through the WalMart channel.

This novelty is further seen in the proposition that blockchain can achieve this objective. Blockchain's distributed ledger framework achieves improved inventory control, improved demand forecasting, and more efficient just-in-time productivity as factors to reduce cost-loading in the global supply chain. Another novel contribution of this paper involves the assertion that blockchain's very methodology of requiring the confirmation of every single process by every single node in the network works to smooth out variation in the supply chain. Also, blockchain's ability to anticipate fluctuations in the supply chain that traditional SCM platforms cannot also works to reduce volatility because production can be increased or decreased in advance of anticipated variations. Blockchain also works to ensure that administrative fluctuations and variances do not adversely affect the supply chain. Blockchain more seamlessly supports contract formulation and exchange, smart contracts, remotely managed containers and cost reductions which all improve the JIT operating environment. Additionally, unlike traditional supply chain technology platforms like ERP and similar, blockchain allows every party involved in SCM to access the virtual supply chain in real-time. The contributions regarding blockchain and the global supply chain then are such that blockchain allows supply chain operators and retailers to more accurately assess costs per unit for forecasting purposes. This allows costs to be reduced over time and in an incremental fashion."

Five different cooperation models, including decentralized TSC without processing consumer information (CI), decentralized TSC without CI sharing, centralized TSC without CI sharing, decentralized TSC with CI sharing and centralized TSC with CI sharing, are analyzed on how to affect the behaviors of TSC members. We find that each member of TSC can benefit from processing CI in OSC. Adopting centralized TSC with CI sharing is the most profitable for the whole supply chain and manufacturer of TSC with CI sharing has to pay more effort into processing CI. Then, the price interval of manufacturer charging for CI sharing is discussed. Finally, some managerial insights are obtained from numerical analysis.

By assuming that demand is uniformly distributed, and considering the factors of the fixed investment cost, tag price and shrinkage recovery rate, both RFID and non-RFID cases are analyzed under two scenarios: (1) in the centralized supply chain, the Newsvendor model is applied to investigate the impact of applying RFID technology on inventory control policy and supply chain profit; (2) in the decentralized supply chain, the wholesale price contract is formulated to characterize the supply chain partners' decisions on ordering quantity, wholesale price and profits. We find that when the fixed cost and variable tag cost of RFID technology are shared between the retailer and the manufacturer, the retailer is much more sensitive than the supplier to the sharing proportion of RFID fixed investment cost as well as the tag price."

General systems theory and the contingency approach serve as theoretical underpinning. Findings - Not only the internal processes and management activities, e.g. in manufacturing and order fulfillment, of producers are affected by a changeover to AM, but also the SCM processes and components relating to the supply and demand side of a firm's supply chain.

Originality/value - The research adds to the widely unexplored effects that AM technology usage in customized parts production has on SCM processes and components. Moreover, the general lack of case studies analyzing the implications of AM technology adoption from a supply chain perspective is addressed. The resulting propositions may serve as a starting point for further research on the impact of AM in engineer-to-order supply chains."

Finally, the mean-CVaR-based revenue-sharing contract is used to coordinate the supply chain and profit distribution. The research shows that, under the condition of decentralized decision-making, when the retailer's optimal order quantity is low, it is an increasing function of the weighted proportion and the risk aversion degree, while, when the retailer's optimal order quantity is high, it is an increasing function of the weighted proportion, and has nothing to do with the risk aversion degree. The manufacturer's blockchain technology application degree is a reduction function of the weighted proportion. When the retailer's order quantity is low, the manufacturer's blockchain technology application degree is a decreasing function of risk aversion, while, when the retailer's order quantity is high, the manufacturer's blockchain technology application is independent of risk aversion. The profit of the supply chain system under centralized decision-making is higher than that of decentralized decision-making. The revenue sharing contract can achieve the coordination of the supply chain to the level of centralized decision-making. Through blockchain technology, transaction costs among members of the supply chain can be reduced, information sharing can be realized, and the benefits of the supply chain can be improved. Finally, the specific numerical simulation is adopted to analyze the weighted proportion, risk aversion and the impact of blockchain technology on the supply chain, and verify the relevant conclusions."

We find that the financing risk of carbon emission technology upgradation does not affect either chain's choices of equilibrium quantities and prices in the complete information case. If this information is incomplete for the traditional supply chain, financing risk plays an important role in determining optimal quantities and optimal prices. To encourage the use of clean energy technology to reduce carbon emissions, government should use the per-product carbon emission tax to encourage the traditional supply chain to upgrade its carbon emission technology, and should encourage financial institutions to provide preferential loans to the supply chain that has carbon emission technology disadvantage in the market."

However, the implementation of closed-loop supply chain is confronted with numerous barriers and challenges due to uncertainties in input as well as in process. In contrast to manufacturing process where the input is mostly homogeneous raw material, the reverse chain's input comes from product's end-of-use or end-of-life; therefore the timing, quality and quantity are uncertain. The recovery process also brings other challenges due to various quality grades of the product returns and various recovery options. On the other hand, information technology has been studied extensively in relation to supply chain management. Most of the works show that the use of information technology could enhance supply chain performance. However, the study on the importance of information technology in closed-loop supply chain is still limited. In this paper, we discuss the role of information technology and then propose a conceptual framework of decision making in adopting IT in closed-loop supply chain management. We propose a conceptual framework for IT adoption decision making with four essential key attributes that are evaluated for each of the closed-loop supply chain activities."

It provides information flow that makes the supply chain more robust and resilient without undermining its efficiency. Smart systems use artificial intelligence methods for solving problems and facilitating decision-making through rule-based deduction. Accordingly, these systems can present specialists' skills and simulate their thinking process. The primary goal of expert systems is to implement knowledge acquisition process by converting knowledge to wisdom. This process is vital for critical decision-making regarding important issues such as determining necessities of a particular contract. Companies use professional liability insurance of the products and services to ensure the purchasers and prevent potential losses. Although this practice is highly prevalent, there is not any particular procedure for measuring necessities of contracts. The main purpose of this paper is to design a fuzzy expert system for measuring the necessities of professional contracts regarding insurance coverage and improve the supply chain management using IT. This system can measure and report these obligations, considering specifications of each project. Taking into perspective variety of professional services/products, we consider software as a type of professional contracts, extract its important indices and give it to the system as the input. After the necessary stages, the system produces a proper response and presents the generated response to the user. The software of this expert system is web based, and there are four operating layers in its architecture. We implemented this program in MS Visual Studio Framework with C#.NET programming language. Moreover, we implemented MS SQL-Server Database Management."

However, earlier research lacks 1) an integrated framework that corresponds to diverse processes for supply chain management and 2) an explanation of how IT flexibility affects firms’ performance in the supply chain context. To fill these gaps, our study theorised a research model by integrating disparate streams of IT flexibility research with three types of IT flexibility, namely, operational, transactional, and strategic, and tested both the direct and indirect effects of the three IT flexibility types on firm performance. Our theoretical model uses an extended resource-based view to highlight the role of IT flexibility in managing interdependent firm relationships in supply chains. Using a partial least squares approach to structured equation modelling analysis on 162 questionnaires from supply chain practitioners, we found two significant relationships: (1) transactional IT flexibility affects operational IT flexibility, and (2) operational IT flexibility affects strategic IT flexibility. Transactional IT flexibility also affects strategic IT flexibility, thus playing a pivotal role in the effectiveness of the other two flexibility types. In addition, it was identified that transactional and operational flexibilities affect firm performance indirectly, via process integration capability, while strategic flexibility directly affects firm performance. By classifying diverse IT flexibility attributes into three types, a comprehensive and explicit concept of IT flexibility in inter-organisational relationships is attained, which allows practitioners to target key resource investments to realise the full potential of IT in the supply chain."

Incorporating information sharing and learning effect plays a significant role in determining the efficiency and the benefit of supply chain. Therefore, this study investigates the interaction between information sharing and learning effect in a closed-loop supply chain by developing three remanufacturing modes including no-remanufacturing, original equipment manufacturer remanufacturing and third-party remanufacturer remanufacturing under technology licensing. The results demonstrate the information sharing and learning effect have a negative impact on the procurement price and procurement quantity. A higher procurement price would be achieved under information sharing scenarios compared to no information sharing scenarios when the retailer reveals a larger demand information to the manufacturer. Since the original equipment manufacturer can make more accurate pricing decisions based on the shared information, he can obtain more payoffs when he receives demand information from the retailer. Comparatively, the procurement price in third-party remanufacturer remanufacturing scenario is higher than that in original equipment manufacturer remanufacturing scenario if the learning effect factor is relatively large. Moreover, the learning effect can bring a payoff increase to the original equipment manufacturer because a higher learning effect factor can save more production cost. These results can help achieve an optimal approach of learning effect and information sharing in a closed-loop supply chain with technology licensing."

In the wake of Bitcoin’s success, the retail industry sees potential in using blockchain technology to tackle some of these challenges. While blockchain technology itself has been subject to extensive research lately, the intersection between blockchain technology and supply chain traceability is still rather unexplored. Since the industry wishes to better understand the benefits and limitations of the technology in their context, this study aims to guide businesses in this assessment. Purpose The purpose with this thesis is to develop a framework for evaluating the applicability of blockchain technology in supply chain management to improve traceability. Methodology A sequential method was used with three phases: 1) a literature review on existing theory which condensed to a theoretical model, 2) an interview study with experts in relevant fields to improve and adjust the model, and 3) an interview study with business representatives to validate the model and also to reach conclusions on the applicability of blockchain technology in this context. Conclusions The evaluation framework was successfully developed. In the evaluation, businesses first identify the drivers for traceability, and map the current traceability system to identify what improvements are needed to satisfy the driver. Secondly, key properties of blockchain technology are assessed, and a draft for an application is designed. Lastly, the drafted application is evaluated based on goal fulfilment, data requirements, degree of novelty and complexity of the application, and the inherent technical limitations of blockchains. Two hypothetical use-cases are presented in the study, and their limitations are discussed. The first case uses a blockchain for storing digital certificates of products to combat fraud, the second case uses a blockchain for storing the same type of traceability data as the companies store right now, only in a distributed fashion. While some properties of blockchain technology are aligned with some of the core concepts of successful traceability, it is still difficult to pinpoint exactly how blockchain technology should be used to effectively improve traceability."

To study this phenomenon, researchers have focused on one or some of these five salient factors: Information Technology Integration (IT), Inter-organizational Trust (TR), Relational Governance (RG), Transaction Cost (TC), and Supply Chain Performance (PE). In this study, we develop a research model that includes all these five factors by synthesizing and integrating theoretical perspectives: transaction cost economics, and relational governance. Our theoretical model clarifies the intricate relationships between the five factors by positioning two common resources for the supply chain: Inter-organizational Trust and IT, as the independent variables that influence outcome measures: performance, and reduction in transaction costs. Relational governance, which facilitates joint decision making, is theorized as playing a central role between the resources and the outcome measures. Data collected from 167 purchasing and supply chain managers provides strong support to our research model. Our findings should help researchers as well as practitioners to develop a more complete and transparent understanding of the relevant mechanisms with which the partnership resources, exert their beneficial effects on supply chain outcomes."

Varzandeh, et al. (2016) analyzed the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis as a product of three measurements. These three measurements include the probability of the occurrence and the severity of the effect and the ability of the process to detect the existence of the stated problems. Subsequently, for reducing RI, they suggest managers find ways to (1) reduce the chance of occurrences, or (2) reduce the severity of their impacts, or (3) improve detection capabilities at a time, or a combination of the three measurements together. This study expands on the previous research and explores the impact of technology on global supply chain risk. Following the recognition of the potential contribution of technology as a risk reduction tool, a survey instrument that measures the familiarity of the supply chain mangers and their usage of technology to control and to reduce risks is introduced. Responses from three groups of supply chain managers working for large, medium, and small companies are analyzed, and the results are reported. The results point to a need for increased awareness of potential known and unknown risks, and ever increasing use of technology to manage global supply chain risks effectively.

The construct was then tested empirically using the sample of 200 Polish companies. Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) were based on a structured questionnaire, then, data exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed. The conducted EFA determined four main factors for information management and integration in the supply chain that should be considered, namely, information characteristics, ICT used in information management, the scope of information and shared performance metrics. Results confirmed the importance of some of the factors related to information management in the supply chain, however having a different set of variables than indicated in the literature. Additionally, research introduced new factors, namely, information characteristics and the scope of shared information, instead of information quality and information content. Moreover, findings suggested that the key role in supply chain information integration was related to established technologies, focused on transport, customer, and ERP management, while emerging technologies, such as cloud computing and data mining were not of the top importance among the surveyed companies."

It is found that, when both market demand and supply quantity of used products face large-scale positive disruptions, the manufacturer's licensing behavior will be enhanced because he can extract more remanufacturing profits by charging a higher licensing fee. While if the negative disruptions of market demand and supply quantity of used products are large enough, the manufacturer's incentive to license the third party to conduct remanufacturing will be weakened due to a smaller remanufacturing profit shared from the third party. The manufacturer would adjust the wholesale price and the licensing fee to realize the maximum profit and coordinate the forward and reverse flows. Additionally, there exists a robust region for the production decisions and the licensing fee when the channel faces disruptions."

Established blockchains are envisioned to solve current supply chain challenges around data monitoring, transparency, and authenticity; However, there is a lack of knowledge in how to establish industry-wide blockchains in the first place. Based on working examples and academic research results of blockchain technology in supply chain management, common supply chain properties are identified that blockchain technology is believed to improve. These characteristics are critically discussed with respect to the operating mode of blockchains, assessing the technology’s actual potential to improve these properties. Pitfalls and chances of blockchain technology itself and its use within supply chains are elucidated. The consideration of supply chain properties and pitfalls and chances leads to an implementation agenda, highlighting the importance of standardization and technology governance. This explorative study suggests that companies engage in a collective action initiative in order to agree on standards, rethink the role of certain industry players and establish participatory governance mechanisms. It recognizes the importance of establishing one single source of truth that is accepted by all industry participants. Companies going forward with their own protocols will have to adjust their systems once a standard is established."

It is often complex due to the rapid development of economic globalization and the intense competition pressure in the market which resulted in information sharing within a supply chain to be fragmented. Blockchain technology can solve this problem by having only a 'one trusted ledger' that could reshape the element of data trust. The goal of this paper is to identify and understand the impact of blockchain technology for information sharing within a supply chain. The decentralized nature of blockchain technology offers a high level of transparency and has gained the attention from various sectors to deploy this technology. A systematic literature review in the academic literature was conducted using different databases. Blockchain-enabled information sharing can add value to enhance collaborative work in different types of supply chains such as health and medical, construction and smart city. From our findings, one potential impact of deploying blockchain-enabled information sharing within a supply chain is that it ensures all members in the chain can obtain verified information which enhances collaborative partnerships. Through this in-depth research, we highlighted potential barriers that could impede the development of blockchain technology in supply chain such as the lack of understanding of blockchain technology in businesses and conflict of interests. Future work such as information hiding, in parallel with information sharing, could close the gap in deploying this technology within a supply chain. Understanding the nature of different supply chain is also important to better prepare the deployment of blockchain. We acknowledge that our approach in selecting literatures in our systematic review may exclude certain literatures. Nonetheless, we tried to include as many relevant literatures as possible, to develop a roadmap on the current situation of blockchain-enabled information sharing within a supply chain."

BT provides better visibility and transparency by removing the disadvantages of trust related issues in a supply chain. In this paper, we advance the literature on BT and its adoption in the supply chain by developing, and statistically validating a model for understanding the user perceptions on BT adoption. The model is based on the integration of three adoption theories- technology acceptance model (TAM), technology readiness index (TRI) and the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Based on a survey of 181 supply chain practitioners in India the proposed model was tested using structural equation modelling. The study found that the TRI constructs- Insecurity and discomfort have an insignificant effect on the perceived ease of use and usefulness. Perceived usefulness, attitude, and perceived behavioural control affect the behavioural intention. Subjective norm has a negligible impact on behavioural intention. This is one of the preliminary studies on BT adoption in supply chain and the findings imply that the supply chain practitioners perceive BT adoption free of efforts and would help them to derive maximum benefits for improving the supply chain effectiveness."

The study intends to provide new critical insights on how blockchain-based technologies can be implemented in the food supply chain and to further the discussion of social and environmental implications of blockchain-based technologies. The results highlight how blockchain is not a stand-alone-technology, but rather one element in a system of technologies. While blockchain-based technologies are expected to bring a variety of impacts, only some are directly attributable to the blockchain element: increased transparency, traceability, and trust.

However, the parties involved in the agrifood supply chain are numerous and physically dispersed, which makes data and information management difficult. As a result, the production process is not transparent and trust is difficult to build. In the horticultural sector, technological innovation in traceability is crucial from a economical point of view. An increasing demand in society for greater information about food reflects the need for more transparency. At the same time, more and more fresh products are accompanied by a variety of certification schemes, with an increasing risk of fraud and adulteration. Within this context, cooperatives of fresh fruits and vegetables can gain additional benefits from the implementation of blockchain technology. This paper seeks to make an initial contribution to the emerging public debate on this issue by providing an overview of blockchain and its application in agriculture, examining implications for food transparency and identifying some potential challenges for agri-food cooperatives. Based on the above reasons, the main purpose of this article is to conceptualize, design and test a traceability system of the agri-food supply chain based on blockchain technology that helps agri-food cooperatives to improve transparency regarding the origin and the processes incorporated into the product. Methodology A new model that involves blockchain and a smart contract to coordinate the tracking of food in the agriculture supply chain is presented in this paper. The food supply chain involves many different actors such as farmers, manufacturers, logistics, wholesalers, resellers, retailers and supermarkets. This system is currently inefficient and unreliable. In the current situation, much of the data and information on compliance are recorded on paper or stored in a centralized database. Through the development of a Proof of Concept (PoC) in the field of agri-food supply chain traceability, the possible implications of the blockchain are explored. The PoC based on a case related to the berries of southern Spain is developed through the construction of a demonstrator that monitors the different nodes involved in the supply chain. The demonstrator is based on a previous analysis of the berries supply chain and the interactions between farmers, the cooperative, its certifiers, logistics providers, retailers and supermarkets, in order to allow a digital representation of a batch of berries to be associated with a unique and immutable digital certificate. To prove the origin and the traceability of the berries production and to be able to customize the roles of each actor in the supply chain with blockchain, the PoC concept was developed in a Spanish farmers cooperative with a permissioned ledger (hyperledger) and a smart contract. Results At the moment, few would question the relevance of blockchain to agri-food. The main question of adopting blockchain technology in the traceability of goods in the agri-food supply chain, is related to the added value compared to existing ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) solutions. This PoC has shown that it is feasible to incorporate basic information from the field and manufacturing processes, packaging and shipping into a chain of blocks with an authorized general ledger and a smart contract. Compared to traditional situations with centralized databases, the PoC demonstrator shows how blockchain can be used to ensure that different agents share the same level of information about the validity and provenance of inviolable certificates. This new supply chain architecture via blockchain can provide the relevant data to the participants, it can maintain confidentiality and can spread data effectively among the participants that use the blockchain technology. Therefore, the PoC pilot demonstrated that the blockchain technology could be used successfully in that context. Furthermore, given the experimentation carried out, it was shown that a medium-sized server (eg VPS in cloud) could function properly as a node for the purposes of this type of use case. There was also no need for special hardware, and the software infrastructure (eg Hyperledger Fabric) is open source and for free. During the development of the PoC, it was learned that it is important to maintain periodic dialogues between stakeholders in order to achieve a better understanding of the interests of each one and to identify common bases for the application of blockchain. The experience in this project shows that the meetings, in which different stakeholders presented and debated different use cases, are a good mechanism for expanding the agri-food blockchain ecosystem. Conclusions The advantage of this model over the centralized models is that all the products are tracked with blockchain and with this traceability it is possible to give confidence to the final consumers about the origin of the products because all the data and transactions carried out in the chain are recorded in the blockchain and managed through a smart contract. The PoC shows that this system is efficient, safe, transparent and avoids intermediaries, which results in lower costs while generating greater confidence in retailers, supermarkets and consumers, which is particularly beneficial for small farmers and cooperatives The research findings contribute to a better understanding of the blockchain technology for the various stakeholders in the fresh food chain, especially for cooperatives, being an opportunity for the improvement of reputation and competitiveness in a highly globalized economy. Several limitations were found for the PoC demonstrator. First, the amount of data and information that is shared is very limited. As with most PoC pilots, the project has not yet been able to demonstrate how the system would work when handling a large number of transactions. In addition, our demonstrator focused on a single smart contract. In practice, however, multiple smart contracts would need to be implemented for the different contractual relationships and to keep the transaction data visible only to the relevant subset of participants. Mistakes in the smart contract design have also shown that testing, validation and rigorous semantics are essential to avoiding significant damage to business relationships. Finally, to take full advantage of the power of blockchain, the adoption of this technology by several cooperatives is recommended. Most cooperatives are too small or have a lack of knowledge to invest in blockchain by themselves. In summary, blockchain is a promising technology for the competitiveness of cooperatives. The near future will show if blockchain technology will become a reliable and transparent way to provide a differential value for agri-food cooperatives."

This paper considers weight reduction technology selection and network design problem in a real-world corporation in China which produces, sells and recycles polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles used for soft drinks. The problem is addressed while taking consideration of future regulations of carbon emissions restrictions. First, a deterministic mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to analyze the influence of economic cost and carbon emissions for different selections in terms of the weight of PET bottle, raw material purchasing, vehicle routing, facility location, manufacturing and recycling plans, etc. Then, the robust counterpart of the proposed mixed-integer linear programming model is used to deal with the uncertainty in supply chain network resulting from the weight reduction. Finally, results show that though weight reduction is both cost-effective and environmentally beneficial, the increased cost due to the switching of the filling procedure from hot-filling to aseptic cold-filling and the incumbent uncertainties have impacts on the location of the Pareto frontier. Besides, we observe that the feasible range between economic cost and carbon emission shrinks with weightreduction; and the threshold of restricted volume of carbon emission decreases with the increase of uncertainty in the supply chain network."

Drawing from the resource-based view, this study proposes that IT-enabled supply chain capabilities are firm-specific, and hard-to-copy across organizations. These capabilities can serve as a catalyst in transforming IT-related resources into higher value for a firm. Based on data collected from surveying supply chain and logistics managers in various industries, the present study sheds light on these issues.

Based on the findings, the impact of information technology infrastructure flexibility exhibited mixed results on the constructs studied. Executive information technology competencies tended to positively influence the different types of supply chain integration. Internal integration was found to have a direct influence on organisational performance. Such internal integration is being encouraged by external entities including customers and suppliers. In this context, more integration might lead to more effective organisational performance. Therefore, it is concluded that organisations should integrate their resources, processes and in the process encourage effective utilisation of information."

Today's manufacturing companies are not striving for individual capacities but for the effective working with green supply chains. However, in addition to environmental and social objectives, cost and economic feasibility has become one of the most critical success factors for improving supply chain management with green component procurement collaboration, especially for the electronics OEM (original equipment manufacturing) companies whose procurement costs often make up a very high proportion of final product prices. This paper presents a case study from the systems perspective by using System Dynamics simulation analysis and statistical validations with empirical data. Empirical data were collected from Taiwanese manufacturing chains-among the world's largest manufacturing clusters of high technology components and products-and their global green suppliers to examine the benefits of green component procurement collaborations in terms of shared costs and improved shipping time performance. Two different supply chain collaboration models, from multi-layer ceramic capacitor (MLCC) and universal serial bus 3.0 (USB 3.0) cable procurements, were benchmarked and statistically validated. The results suggest that the practices of collaborative planning for procurement quantity and accurate fulfillment by suppliers are significantly related to cost effectiveness and shipping time efficiency. Although the price negotiation of upstream raw materials for the collaborative suppliers has no statistically significant benefit to the shipping time efficiency, the shared cost reduction of component procurement is significantly positive for supply chain collaboration among green manufacturers. Managerial implications toward sustainable supply chain management were also discussed."

Further, the study explored the moderating role of technology orientation on organizational culture dimensions and healthcare resilience linkages. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a multi-unit study of different hospital supply chains (SCs). Consequently, perceptual data were gathered from seven dominant entities in a typical medical/hospital SC: hospitals, hotels, chemistry and pharmaceutical, marketing/public relations/promotion, medical equipment manufacturers and surgical suppliers, food and beverage providers (i.e. restaurants) and insurance providers. The responses were gathered using online survey and were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: Based on 276 completed responses, positive influences were found for development, group and rational cultures on HCRES. As expected, a negative influence of hierarchical culture was found on HCRES. Further, technological orientation was found to enhance the positive effects of development, group and rational cultures on HCRES. However, no prominent moderation was noted for hierarchical culture’s influence on HCRES. The findings suggested managers to focus more on developing competing values framework (CVF)-based dimensions of organizational culture dimensions for effective risk mitigation so as to provide healthcare services in a timely manner to patients. Originality/value: The study is the first to investigate the effects of organizational culture’s dimensions on resilience. The study has empirically established the association between CVF view and dynamic capabilities. The study underlined the importance of resilience in healthcare SCs. Resilience is an important dynamic capability in healthcare SCs to provide uninterrupted treatments and services to patients. Any failure in such a service can be fatal. Further, the study developed the measures of development, group, rational and hierarchical culture for further investigation in healthcare. This study is also the first to develop a measure for resilience in the healthcare sector."

The manufacturing and food supply chains are contributing significantly to the large-scale carbon emissions. Beef supply chain is one of the segments of food industry having considerable carbon footprint throughout its supply chain. The major emissions are occurring at beef farms in the form of methane and nitrous oxide gases. The other carbon hotspots in beef supply chain are abattoir, processor, logistics and retailer. There is a huge amount of pressure from government authorities to all the business firms to cut down carbon emissions. The different stakeholders of beef supply chain especially small and medium-sized stakeholders, lack in technical and financial resources to optimize and measure carbon emissions at their end. There is no integrated system which can address this issue for the entire beef supply chain. Keeping the same in mind, in this paper, an integrated system is proposed using Cloud Computing Technology (CCT) where all stakeholders of beef supply chain can minimize and measure carbon emission at their end within reasonable expenses and infrastructure. The integrated approach of mapping the entire beef supply chain by a single cloud will also improve the coordination among its stakeholders. The system boundary of this study will be from beef farms to the retailer involving logistics, abattoir and processor in between. The efficacy of the proposed system is demonstrated in a simulated case study."

However, at present, the implications of vertical strategic interactions for green technology investment in a supply chain are not all that clear. In particular, such a vertical interaction not only can translate into profits between different parties, but usually also involves differentiated environmental performance. A question which arises is: who is the right undertaker for green technology investment in a supply chain, the supplier or retailer? To answer this question, we highlight the implications of vertical strategic interaction for green technology investment in a supply chain. To fill this gap, using a game-theoretic approach, we formulate two models: (a) Model M, in which an upstream manufacturer adopts technologies to meet consumer demand; and (b) Model R, where a retailer integrates environmental concerns into their supply chain decisions. We find that the retailer, who is closer to the customer, is the more effective undertaker for green technology investment, as this not only creates higher profitability for both parties, but also achieves a more sustainable scheme for our environment. When green technologies are invested in by the manufacturer, the double marginalization effect not only may downward-distort their economic performance but can also reduce the equilibrium of product greenness."

The objectives of this study are to examine and analyze the effects of trust variables on supply chain performance, trust on commitment, commitment on supply chain performance, information technology on supply chain performance, and effects of trust variable on supply chain performance through commitment variable to Small and Medium Industries (SMIs) of passion fruit processing in Makassar. This study used a quantitative approach, where the questionnaire as main tools for data collection. Data were analyzed by descriptive analysis and partial least square-path modeling (PLS- PM). Data computation used SmartPLS 2.0 Software. The results show that trust has a significant effect on supply chain performance, and it also has a significant effect on commitment. Furthermore, commitment has a significant effect on supply chain performance, and information technology has a significant effect on supply chain performance. Trust can improve the supply chain performance by commitment indirectly, and it gives smaller effect on supply chain performance directly than indirectly mediated by commitment. Then, supply chain performance is more influenced by information technology rather than trust and commitment. The results of this study may have implications for the important role of management in maintaining trust, commitment and utilizing information technology in the supply chain system"

In this paper, the appropriateness of BT in Supply Chain Management (SCM) according to different sectors has been evaluated by using a MCDM methodology based on hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs). The suggested MCDM methodology consists of Delphi method, hesitant fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (HF-AHP) and Hesitant Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (HF-TOPSIS) methods. In the first stage, the criteria and sub-criteria utilized for performance evaluation of BT in supply chain management have been determined by using Delphi method. The weights of main and sub-criteria have been obtained through HF-AHP method and finally, the alternative sectors have been ranked according to results of HF-TOPSIS method. For this aim, a hierarchical MCDM problem that consists of 5 main and 17 sub-criteria has been created and the alternative sectors have been evaluated. As a result, medicine/drug and jewelry sectors have been respectively determined as the most and the least suitable alternatives in order to implement BT by means of the proposed HFSs based methodology.

However, distribution channels are complex and Supply Chain Management (SCM) is autonomously executed in each company. However, the existence centralized outcome has endured with confined data storage and lack of trust during the involvement of multiple parties. In order to overcome these issues, an approach of decentralized block chain is required by generating digital representation for physical goods to promote tracking over several entities. There are several existing challenges which involve lack in transparency, lack in traceability, complex in risk management, disruption, requirement for creating reputation and trust. Hence, one of the leading technologies is block chain which has the potential in resolving few coordination challenges in SCM by smart contract for handling the multiple exchanges between parties. Block chain technology has reduced the complexity, better transparency and verification of trustless oversupply chain. These can be done through smart contracts which provide a digital agreement among the transaction parties using ethereum during assist of writing computer code and even implemented in block chain that makes the client to self-execute while they are accommodated with predetermined situation. Thus, it helps for accelerating the supply chain which made more agile and foster strengthens relationship among partners.

This paper aims to extend the Verhoeven et al.’s (2018) framework and empirical research beyond the use case stage into the pilot stage. Design/methodology/approach: Three case studies in different industries (logistics services, consumer products and retail), supply chain positions (manufacturer, carrier, and retailer) and geographies (Europe and USA) are conducted to explore lessons learned by early adopters of blockchain technology in the supply chain. Findings: The case studies indicate that the Verhoeven et al.’s (2018) screens, with one added screen, are helpful in considering “what to adopt.” Based on the insights from the case studies, it is also possible to develop pilot design considerations that can inform “where to start.” Lessons learned include that there is value in scoping pilots in a targeted manner, including the use of existing technology in the pilot (as opposed to replacing existing technology) and that there is the ability to start a pilot fast, provided the existence of executive and stakeholder engagement. Practical implications: In addition to the need to be being mindful in considering what use case for blockchain in the supply chain to potentially adopt, mindful consideration of blockchain technology in the supply chain extends into the design of pilots. Six specific design considerations are offered.

Survey data collected from 249 Chinese firms were used to test research hypotheses. The findings show that both green supplier and customer learning positively influence green product and process innovation. However, green technology turbulence moderates these relationships differently. Specifically, green technology turbulence strengthens the impacts of green customer learning on green product and process innovation, while weakens the impact of green supplier learning on green process innovation. The moderating effect of green technology turbulence on the link between green supplier learning and green product innovation is insignificant.

Its application in supply chain management is also gradually increasing. Supply chain management (SCM) has long been committed to reducing costs and increasing efficiency and is trying to optimise resources and reduce the sector's fragmentation. Trust has always been an important factor in managing supply chain relationships, and it also affects the efficiency of supply chain operations. To this end, this study aims to examine how trust is affected by the introduction of blockchain technology in construction supply chain management. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on semi-structured interviews and publicly available information from experts in blockchain and construction supply chain management. Through content analysis, the data are analysed thematically to explore how various types of trust, such as system-based, cognition-based and relation-based, are affected by blockchain technology. Findings: Blockchain technology provides solutions for data tracking, contracting and transferring resources in supply chain management. These applications help enhance the various sources of trust in SCM and provide supply chain partners with protection mechanisms to avoid the risks and costs of opportunistic behaviour in collaboration, shifting trust from relational to system-based and cognition-based. Research limitations/implications: This study focuses only on inter-organisational rather than interpersonal trust and empirical data from experts whose knowledge and cognition could be subjective. Practical implications: Leveraging the potential of digitalisation to manage trust requires that leaders and managers actively try to improve contractual arrangements, information sharing and being open to new innovative technologies like blockchain. Social implications: From a relational view of supply chain management, the extent to which blockchain technology can develop and spread depends on the readiness of the social capital to accept decentralised governance structures. Originality/value: This study builds upon an original data set and discusses features and applications of blockchain technology, explores the sources and dimensions of trust in supply chain management and explains the impact of blockchain technology on trust."

Steel is one of the most critical raw materials practically used in every aspect of our life, directly or indirectly influencing the industry and economy of a country. The final products of the steel industry can be reused at the end of their lifecycle, making the principles of reverse logistics applicable in the supply chain and turning it to a closed-loop supply chain. In this research, a multi-objective linear mathematical model under uncertainty is developed to optimize a steel sustainable closed-loop supply chain. The existed uncertainty is modeled through a scenario-based method in the stochastic environment, and the proposed multi-objective model is developed following a fuzzy goal programming approach. A real case study is explored in one of the active steel supply chains in Iran to validate the model. The model optimizes total profit, energy, and water consumption, CO2 emission, job opportunity created, and lost working days through determining optimal production technology, whether retailers get changed to hybrid centers or not, and the flow of material and products. The final results show that a mere 1% decrease in the profit can alleviate the harmful environmental effects by 5%. Finally, several managerial implications derived from final results and sensitivity analysis are discussed to provide insights for industry leaders who desire to increase their profits with regard to environmental and social effects."

We firstly consider a two-echelon textile supply chain consisting of one retailer and one manufacturer, where the manufacturer decides to adopt green technology for production. The adoption of green technology can help enhance product greenness and reduce unit production cost. We identify the optimal pricing and the product greenness decisions for the retailer and the manufacturer, respectively. We extend our model to examine the effects of retail competition. As the manufacturer produces for both retailers, there are spillover effects on clean technology cost reduction. We find that the optimal greenness levels are increasing in the environmental taxes and when the coefficient of competition is higher, the greenness levels are also higher. We identify the spillover effects on sustainable supply chain with clean technology adoption: the spillover effects are higher, the degree of green technology is increasing. More managerial insights are discussed."

Managing disruption and its effects has therefore become a key focus for firms. While the process of disruption management has attracted considerable research attention, much of it has been directed at the pre-disruption stage. This study investigates the post-disruption stage, and its management. The unpredictability of disruption magnitude and nature suggests that the post-disruption management process may be as important, if not more so, than pre-determined pre-disruption strategies. An effective post-disruption management process would directly affect actual ability to recover from sudden and serious disruptions. This study analyzes six companies, variously positioned upstream and downstream in the supply chain of the information and communications technology (ICT) industry in Taiwan. Specific factors and strategies relating to the post-disruption management process were collected by conducting in-depth interviews with the managers and executives of the firms. The information was categorized into distinct disruption management process stages: discovery, recovery, and supply chain redesign. The study findings are interesting and at times, new and counter-intuitive, including the surprising positive effects of clustering in disruptions, and the role of back-up supplier and material verification in disruption recovery. The study emerges with an integrated framework that can be utilized to establish an effective post-disruption management process.

The desire for greater interoperability is also driven by the need to reduce business risk through more informed management decisions. Interoperability is achieved by the development of a technology architecture that guides the design and implementation of communication systems existing within individual businesses and between businesses comprising the supply chain. Technology architectures are developed through a purposeful dialogue about why the architecture is required, the benefits and opportunities that the architecture offers the industry, and how the architecture will translate into practical results. An assessment of how the finance, travel, and health industries and a sector of the food industry—fresh produce—have implemented interoperability was conducted to identify lessons learned that can aid the development of interoperability in the seafood industry. The findings include identification of the need for strong, effective governance during the establishment and operation of an interoperability initiative to ensure the existence of common protocols and standards. The resulting insights were distilled into a series of principles for enabling syntactic and semantic interoperability in any industry, which we summarize in this article. Categorized as “structural,” “operational,” and “integrative,” the principles describe requirements and solutions that are pivotal to enabling businesses to create and capture value from full chain interoperability. The principles are also fundamental to allowing governments and advocacy groups to use traceability for public good."

Long-term judgments from an international panel of 108 designated experts from academia, industry, and politics/associations with different context-related backgrounds (blockchain, SCM, hybrid functions) were systematically analyzed. The results reveal prospective scenarios how blockchains will be applied in SCM by 2035 and which SCM-specific obstacles need to be solved in advance. One key finding reveals that even though blockchain technology is said to enable transactions between untrusted parties, trust-related advantages of blockchain technology are not directly transferable to SCM without additional conditions. Counterintuitively, active trust management between supply chain partners will still be needed. Nonetheless, this research reveals that blockchain technology will be strongly applied in SCM by 2035 and thus provides beneficial orientation and stimulating perspectives for decision-makers in the field."

We examine a technology supplier's licensing decision in such emerging multiparty networked supply chains in which a downstream design firm's capability may not be publicly known. We find that the supply chain and firm profits are critically affected by whether or not a license agreement between a technology supplier and a design firm is kept confidential from a manufacturer. Instead of licensing to two downstream firms, a technology supplier may also license to an integrated firm with both design and manufacturing capabilities, which forms a conventional vertical supply chain. We compare a networked supply chain with a vertical supply chain and show that the network model can, under some conditions, outperform the integrated configuration and increase profits for all supply chain entities. In particular, a downstream firm can be better off decentralized, with design and manufacturing functions taken by different firms. Our research helps explain the emergence of such networked supply chains and offers insights on how to structure them to improve outcomes."

The authors test whether BDA mediates the impact of institutional response to supply chain disruption events, and information technology infrastructure capabilities (ITICs), on firm’s ability to develop risk resilience from supply chain disruption events. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on survey data collected from 225 firms, spread across several sectors in the USA and Europe. The respondents are primarily senior and middle management professionals who have experience within the information technology (IT) and supply chain domain. Validity and reliability analyses were performed using SPSS and AMOS; and covariance-based structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesis. Findings: The analysis reveals two significant findings. First, the authors observe that institutional experience with managing supply chain disruption events has a negative impact on firm’s ability to develop business risk resilience. However, if the organizations adopt BDA capabilities, it enables them to effectively utilize resident firm knowledge and develop supply chain risk resilience capacity. The results further suggest that BDA positively adds to an organization’s existing IT capabilities. The analysis shows that BDA mediates the impact of ITIC on the organization’s ability to develop risk resilience to supply chain disruption events. Originality/value: This study is one of the few works that empirically validate the important role that BDA capabilities play in enabling firms develop business risk resilience from supply chain disruption events.

The customers' acceptance of blockchain technology in logistics and supply chain is tested through “Technology Acceptance Model” by using attitude, perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), behavioral intention and use behavior. Design/methodology/approach: Data has been collected through online and offline medium, where active 240 responses have been collected finally using convenience sampling. Confirmatory factor analysis with structural equation modeling (SEM) was carried out for data analysis. Findings: The customers' acceptance of blockchain technology in logistics and supply chain is tested through “Technology Acceptance Model.” The findings reveal model fit where PEOU, PU and attitude are the major constructs of the model to realize the substantial gains in logistics process efficiency. Research limitations/implications: Convenience sampling has been considered for the study to collect the data of online users of various technology applications for tracking and shipment detail, whereas a more specified method sampling can be considered for the future research. The study has been conducted in the Indian context, which has been considered as the limitation pertaining to generalization across countries and industries. Practical implications: The findings of this study will be helpful for market practitioners to build transparency between customers and industry to overcome the frictions in logistics. Blockchain will help in monitoring the performance history and previous commitments of logistics professionals resulting in selecting a responsible logistics solution provider. Access to critical data by the authorized member of the supply chain will reduce unsubstantiated disputes. Social implications: Blockchain technology will be available to everyone on the network. This will bring transparency and help logistics professionals such as carriers, shippers and brokers to detect early frauds and prevent thefts. It will increase customer trust toward any financial transaction for tracking the ownership of titles. Originality/value: Blockchain technology is envisioned to be a technology that could be a game-changer for decentralizing infrastructure, introducing transparency and building trust in the supply chain.

In this paper, we discuss the impact of blockchain technology on supply chain risk management and, in particular, on supply chain resilience. We identify potential risk-related blockchain application scenarios and examine their impact on the existing resilience strategies. We explore the impact of the most promising applications with respect to resilience by using an agent-based simulation model of a complex supply network affected by disruptions. The theoretical analysis reveals a promotion of supply chain resilience strategies, especially if smart contracts are used for risk-related collaboration. The simulation study indicates an increase in resilience if the underlying collaboration is based on time-efficient processes: The propagation of disruptions, the network recovery time, and total costs can be substantially reduced. However, depending on the duration of the disruption, negative effects can occur if process efficiency is insufficient.

We show that depending on the relative strength of the efficiency and security concerns, supply chain stakeholders in a decentralized supply chain face two different coordination problems in investing in the new technology: (1) when security concerns are not strong enough to dominate efficiency concerns, stakeholders may not have a sufficient incentive to invest; therefore, at least one stakeholder under invests. Our analysis shows that internal incentive mechanisms, such as investment cost sharing between stakeholders, are not likely to resolve this underinvestment; instead, external financial incentive mechanisms, such as tax incentives, need to be considered. (2) When security concerns are strong enough to dominate efficiency concerns, stakeholders may not invest at all because of the uncertainty of other stakeholders' behavior, rather than the lack of an incentive to invest in the technology. Our analysis shows that external interventions, such as imposing a penalty for a breach of security, can be used as a way of reducing such behavioral uncertainty. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Existing food traceability systems do not guarantee a high level of system reliability, scalability, and information accuracy. Moreover, the traceability process is time-consuming and complicated in modern supply chain networks. To alleviate these concerns, blockchain technology is promising to create a new ontology for supply chain traceability. However, most consensus mechanisms and data flow in blockchain are developed for cryptocurrency, not for supply chain traceability; hence, simply applying blockchain technology to food traceability is impractical. In this paper, a blockchain-IoT-based food traceability system (BIFTS) is proposed to integrate the novel deployment of blockchain, IoT technology, and fuzzy logic into a total traceability shelf life management system for managing perishable food. To address the needs for food traceability, lightweight and vaporized characteristics are deployed in the blockchain, while an integrated consensus mechanism that considers shipment transit time, stakeholder assessment, and shipment volume is developed. The data flow of blockchain is then aligned to the deployment of IoT technologies according to the level of traceable resource units. Subsequently, the decision support can be established in the food supply chain by using reliable and accurate data for shelf life adjustment, and by using fuzzy logic for quality decay evaluation."

A competitive advantage is based on capabilities that provide the necessary grounds of an organization to differentiate itself from its competitors. The majority of the relevant empirical literature identified price/cost, quality, delivery dependability, product innovation, and time to market as the most decisive sources of competitive advantage. As far as the standards in the economic environment are changing and global competition is fiercer, organizations realize that they have to re-evaluate their enterprise business model in order to gain supply chain efficiencies. To meet these challenges and improve their competitive advantage, companies need to both support their internal functions and exchange information with supply chain partners in an effective way. Therefore, companies must exploit IT including enterprise applications such as ERP and CRM, as well as e-procurement and e-commerce. The empirical findings from a survey of 76 manufacturing firms in Greece confirmed the crucial role of IT practices and techniques on the establishment of a sustainable competitive advantage based on Supply Chain Management.

However, the vast majority of DLT initiatives are discontinued after a short period. With the full potential of DLT laying far down the road, especially managers in supply chain management (SCM) seek for short-term cost-saving effects of DLT in order to achieve long-term benefits of DLT in the future. However, the extant research has bypassed grounding long-term as well as short-term effects of DLT on supply chain transaction with empirical data. We address this shortcoming, following an abductive research approach and combining empirical data from a multiple case study design with the corresponding literature. Our study reveals that the effects of DLT on supply chain transactions are two-sided. We found six effects of DLT solutions that have a cost-reducing or cost avoidance impact on supply chain transactions. In addition, we found two effects that change the power distribution between buyers and suppliers in transactions and a single effect that reduces the dependency of supply chain transactions on third parties. While cost-reducing and avoidance as well as dependency-reducing effects are positive effects, the change in power distribution might come with disadvantages. With these findings, the paper provides the first empirical evidence of the impact of DLT on supply chain transactions, which will enable managers to improve their assessment of DLT usage in supply chains."

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Technology is emerging as a technology that could provide the answer to these problems. Using tags, readers and radio waves to communicate between the two, RFID combined with the EPC (Electronic Product Code) would he able to address these pain points and deliver a whole range of benefits across various verticals like manufacturing, distribution, retail, logistics and security. The potential benefits arise from increase in supply chain visibility, increase in efficiencies and decrease in costs due to better data synchronization. increase in responsiveness to changes due to real time information visibility and a number of additional industry vertical specific benefits.

This new issue motivates us to consider whether a manufacturer should invest in sustainable technology and to study the effects of risk aversion on coordinating a two-stage supply chain comprising of a single manufacturer and a single retailer under a carbon tax policy, which has not been fully investigated in the existing literature. In the mean-variance framework, two optimization models for manufacturer-led decentralized systems with and without technology investment are first developed and then compared to show that the economic and environmental performance of the supply chain can be improved by investing in sustainable technology. An optimization model for a centralized supply chain with technology investment is then solved to derive several coordination conditions. A revenue-sharing contract and a two-part tariff contract are proposed to coordinate the manufacturer-led decentralized system with technology investment. The results show that the former cannot coordinate the supply chain, while the latter can do it only if the retailer is risk-averse. Numerical examples are further offered to illustrate the effects of risk aversion on system coordination under the two-part tariff contract."

The food supply chain is made up of many organizations with different interests, and is often reluctant to share information on traceability with each other. By establishing transparency, Block chain has been promoted to enhance traceability. Practice therefore appeared to be more persistent. The purpose of this paper is to define the boundary conditions for sharing information regarding assurance in order to improve traceability. Four cases were investigated using a template analysis of 16 interviews in the food supply chain. Eighteen boundary requirements were established, classified in the categories industry, policy, efficiency and traceability. Some boundary conditions were found in all supply chains while others were found to be specific to the supply chain. Standardization of traceability processes and interfaces, a joint platform and independent governance have been identified as key boundary conditions before the use of block chain. Our findings imply that supply chain systems need to be modified first and organizational measures need to be taken to meet the boundary conditions before the successful use of block chain can be achieved."

The objective of the study is to optimize preservation investment, the number of shipments and shipment quantity, so that the total cost per unit of time of the supply chain is minimized. The study proposes a solution method, and the results show that investment in preservation technology reduces the total supply chain cost by 13%. Additionally, preservation increases the lot size, thus increasing the production cycle length, which reduces the ordering cost of the system. Furthermore, this study shows that preservation leads to a reduction of solid waste from deteriorated products. Total deteriorated products reduced to 8 units from 235 units, hence, preservation generates positive environmental benefits along with economic impacts. The robustness of the proposed model is illustrated with a numerical example, sensitivity analysis, and graphical representations.

Thus, many IRs aim to lower their costs by cooperating with OEMs through technology licensing or R&D joint venture mechanisms. In this study, we investigate competitive and cooperative interactions in a closed-loop supply chain that includes an OEM and an IR. First, the OEM determines its quality level; according to which the OEM and the IR then choose their respective production quantities. Thus, the OEM's choice of quality level is essential to the subsequent quantity competition between the OEM and the IR. Moreover, two cooperative mechanisms between the OEM and the IR are developed: technology licensing with a licensing royalty and an R&D joint venture for technology co-development. We also investigate firm equilibrium decisions and profits in different models; consider the endogenous settings of cooperation schemes; and compare performance between the cooperative models.

The proposed model for the case application addresses the simultaneous optimization of RFID investment timing and scale, in the face of (a) substantial uncertainty regarding the products circulated from and among the firm's premises and (b) largely irreversible investment costs associated with RFID adoption (hardware infrastructure, tags, training and maintenance, etc.).

Design/methodology/approach: A structured literature review and a theory-driven approach are used. A set of propositions are developed, suggesting how the use of BCT in supply chains can be understood to simultaneously enable and constrain SCM and performance. Findings: The analysis identifies four enabling and three constraining blockchain identities to explain how the technology either “facilitates” or “impedes” SCM and supply chain performance. Traceability, which emanates from its ability to provide data immutability, ranks highly as a core innovation of the technology. The blockchain is mainly seen as an opportunity to exploit existing supply chain resources and competencies. Research limitations/implications: One limitation of the research is its conceptual nature. Future research should test the developed propositions empirically. Further research should focus on BCT as an opportunity to explore and as a relationship-building technology. More research is also needed focussing on the complex and simultaneous enabling and constraining effects of BCT in supply chains. Originality/value: The paper shows the important and complex Janus-faced implications of embedding BCT in supply chains and demonstrates how organisational theory can be applied to explore the relationship between blockchain and SCM."

In addition, the moderating effect of top management is explored. Design/methodology/approach: Using cross-sectional survey data collected from a sample of 105 Australian retail firms, this study used structural equation modelling to test the hypothesised relationship of cloud-enabled SCI with performance in a theoretical model. Findings: Results show that cloud-based technology has positive effect on SCI, and the cloud-enabled SCI is positively related to supply chain performance which eventually influenced firm sustainability. Further, top management intervention moderates the relationship between supplier and internal integration with supply chain performance. But it is found to have no moderating effect on the relationship between customer integration and supply chain performance. Practical implications: Recognising the potential benefits of emerging cloud-based technologies reported in this study, retail managers need to understand that higher order SCI requires the support of cloud-based technology to improve supply chain performance and firm sustainability. Originality/value: This research extends prior research of information and communication technologies-enabled SCI and its effect on supply chain performance which overly remains inconsistent. In addition, IS literature abounds with discussion on cloud computing technology per se, and its adoption in supply chain is overly rhetoric. This study fills this gap by conceptualising the multiple dimensions of SCI enabled by cloud-based technology and the way it affects supply chain and firm sustainable performance. Investigating SCI in context of cloud-based technology is a unique contribution in this study. The moderating effect of top management in this decision also adds to the current body of literature."

Being at the interface between technology, innovation, behavioral science and operations management research, this paper identifies multifaceted factors that determine the decision to adopt AM technologies for the production of industrial parts. A review of the relevant literature revealed eight potential factors. These can be classified into four interdisciplinary categories: technology-related factors, firm-related-factors, market structure-related factors, and supply chain-related factors. Special focus is placed on the impact of supply chain-related issues, because there are indicatives that these aspects have an influence on the decision to adopt AM technologies since AM may offer distinct opportunities for both, the supply- and demand-side of a firm’s operations. No work in the field of manufacturing technology adoption has examined the role of such inter-organizational factors before. The results of an empirical study among 195 firms indicate that demand-side benefits and compatibility are the main determinants of AM technology adoption. This suggests that not only intra- but also inter-organizational factors should be considered when investigating the adoption of technological innovations. Furthermore, it is carved out that the adoption of AM technologies has an interdisciplinary nature."

To control emissions, the port supply chain can implement either shore power (SP) or low sulfur fuel oil (LSFO). The performances of the port supply chain when either SP or LSFO is adopted are compared in this paper. More specifically, according to relative bargaining power between the port and the shipping company, three different game models are constructed to analyze the effects of channel power on equilibrium results when either SP or LSFO is implemented. Results show that both profits and carbon emissions of supply chain using SP are lower than those using LSFO when carbon price is low, but are higher when carbon price is high. However, from the perspective of the social welfare, when both the carbon price and environmental concern are low, or both the carbon price and environmental concern are high, LSFO should be adopted. Otherwise, SP may be more attractive. Compared with the two Stackelberg games, the Nash game leads to higher profits and less emissions. The Nash game also leads to higher social welfare when environmental concern is small, but lower social welfare when environmental concern is large. These findings can provide insights for governments in formulating emission reduction strategies in port supply chain under different scenarios."

This study takes the power supply chain (PSC) in China, composed of coal-fired thermal power plants and downstream power grid enterprises as its primary research object. From the perspective of sustainable development, the study explores and analyzes the sustainable performance and technology heterogeneity of China’s provinces’ PSCs, proposing the two-system model to evaluate the sustainable performance, generation performance and sale performance of PSCs. In addition, to understand the technology level of PSC, this study applies the meta-frontier technique to analyze the technology heterogeneity of all PSCs across different regions. The proposed models are then applied to analyze the sustainable performance of China’s provincial PSCs. The empirical results demonstrate the market-oriented reform of the power industry in China played a role in promoting the development of power generation enterprises in China’s PSCs but had a limited effect on the power grid enterprises in the PSC. The study also shows that there are significant regional differences in the sustainable performance and technology of China’s PSC. Generally, PSCs in Eastern China have a high level of sustainable performance and technology, while the sustainable performance and technology of the PSCs in Central and Northeast China are relatively poor. Based on these empirical results, specific policy recommendations are presented to improve PSC’s sustainable performance and technology levels at government and enterprise levels."

Companies these days are continuously looking to expand their market geographically to attract new customers. With that in mind, the main concern of companies is to achieve their customers' requirements, which makes the supply chain (SC) longer and more complex. This leads to increased difficulty in managing the SC along with controlling risks and disruptions in SC. Such as loss of a critical supplier, a fire accident in the production facility, or an act of terrorism. To deal with these risks, SC must be designed to provide an efficient and effective response, keep its process working and be capable of recovering to their original state after disruptive events, this is considered as the core of supply chain resilience (SCRes). Furthermore, companies that design their SC with capabilities to react quickly to any disruptions in its process have the opportunity to become more stabilized and acquire an improved position in the market. Researchers have been exploring ways to acquire supply chain resilience, such as encouraging and improving collaboration between SC partners or by increasing the organization's visibility through monitoring SC events and patterns. Studies have shown that IT has a role in improving SCRes, such as information-sharing systems to promote collaboration and visibility tactics. However, recent research trends are exploring new and emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT). Despite the growing interest in IoT, minimal research has been carried out for its application in SCRes. Research in this direction is necessary to explore opportunities provided by IoT to redesign SC which in turn reinforces flexibility of supply chains and aspects of analysis of the product quality and how it could enable companies to improve their SCRes. This study is directly focused to identify and highlight this gap."

Drawn upon modular systems theory, this study proposes that system modularity mitigates the risk of adopting digital supply chain systems and therefore motivates firms to digitize more of their supply chain operations. The study theorizes how the risk-mitigating effect of system modularity can be enhanced by the allocation of decision rights to the IT (information technology) unit. The main logic is that IT managers with more domain IT knowledge can better utilize their knowledge in decision making to achieve effective system modularity. We tested these theoretical propositions using a survey study of Chinese companies and found empirical support. We also found that the allocation of decision rights to the IT unit does not directly mitigate the perceived risk of digital supply chain systems, which highlights the role of decision allocation to the IT unit as a key moderator in risk mitigation.

We analyse the impacts of strategic consumer behaviour and the third-party remanufacturing cost on three kinds of remanufacturing scenarios, namely no-remanufacturing, partial-remanufacturing and full-remanufacturing. We adopt a Stackelberg game to obtain the equilibrium strategies of each remanufacturing model and show that the demand of new products decreases and the demand of remanufactured products increases as consumers become more strategic. Considering the manufacturer’s profit decrease due to strategic consumer behaviour, the manufacturer suffers a smaller profit loss when he licenses the third party to remanufacture because he can charge a higher licensing fee from the third party to share remanufacturing revenues. Moreover, the manufacturer prefers the third-party remanufacturing mode rather than the manufacturer–remanufacturing mode if the third-party remanufacturing cost is relatively low and remanufacturing can always bring a profit increase to both the manufacturer and the third party."

Signaling through inventory being only tenable when inventory transactions are verifiable at low enough cost, we then turn our attention to how this verifiability can be achieved in practice and argue that blockchain technology could enable it more efficiently than traditional monitoring mechanisms. To demonstrate, we develop b-verify, an open-source blockchain protocol that leverages Bitcoin to provide supply chain transparency at scale and in a cost-effective way. The paper identifies an important benefit of blockchain adoption-by opening a window of transparency into a firm's supply chain, blockchain technology furnishes the ability to secure favorable financing terms at lower signaling costs.

Yet, blockchain is still nascent, and the extant literature on this technology is scarce, especially as regards the relationship between blockchain and SCM. Additionally, existing studies have not yet addressed sufficiently the enablers of blockchain adoption and the interplay with supply chain performance. In order to reduce this gap, this study aims to examine the potential influence of blockchain on supply chain performance. We draw on the literature on technology adoption and supply chain performance, as well as on the emerging blockchain literature, to develop and test a model in two countries, namely India and the US. Accordingly, we administered a survey in order to review the opinions and views of supply chain practitioners. The results support the model and indicate that blockchain applications can improve supply chain performance. In particular, our findings suggest that knowledge sharing and trading partner pressure play an important role in blockchain adoption, and that supply chain performance is significantly influenced by supply chain transparency and blockchain transparency. Another finding was the inexistence of evidence for a moderation effect of the industry variable on the outcomes. The research conclusions have substantial managerial and theoretical implications. Our model contributes mainly to the theoretical advancement of SCM-blockchain, thus allowing scholars to adapt our validated model."

Specifically, there is a need to provide empirical and systematic analysis of the variables that can explain the various stages of mobile SCM diffusion. A review of recent literature suggests that existing e-supply chain technology adoption literature is not strongly grounded in theory. A theoretical model with six hypotheses was proposed based on the technology-organisation- environment (TOE) framework and innovation diffusion theory (IDT). This study draws its survey responses from a group of manufacturing firms in order to investigate the factors that affect the diffusion of mobile SCM. The results show that the variables derived from TOE and IDT can explain mobile SCM diffusion well. However, interorganisational relationships (IORs) play a crucial role in determining the success of mobile SCM routinisation. This is one of the first known empirical studies on the factors influencing the diffusion of mobile SCM.

It is also expected that AM can facilitate the spare parts supply chain to achieve more economic benefits along with its development. To our knowledge, this paper is one of the early studies that explores the impact of AM on supply chain performance and quantitatively examines the superiority of utilising AM in spare parts supply chain. Some suggestions are also provided to help managers adopting AM in their spare parts supply chains. 1. Introduction Currently, the biggest challenge in supply chain management is the need to efficiently and effectively deliver ever more valuable products and services to customers (Holmström et al. 2010; Christopher 2011). In the context of a spare parts supply chain, customer service is related to meeting customers' demands reliably and consistently to keep their equip-ment in operational condition. Maintenance, repair and operations are closely tied to the accessibility of appropriate parts whenever a customer requires them and to reduce downtime costs (Khajavi, Partanen, and Holmström 2014). Thus, the requirements for a spare parts supply chain differ from those of supply chains for other products in several ways: service requirements are higher as the effects of stock-outs may be financially significant, the demand for parts may be extremely sporadic and difficult to forecast, and the prices of individual parts may be very high (Huiskonen 2001). The ability to supply spare parts with high fulfilment rates at low costs therefore becomes both a strategic opportunity (Wise and Baumgartner 1999) and a challenge for many original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) (Markillie 2012). Typically, companies must invest heavily in their spare parts supply chain operations to reach high fulfilment rates …"

Managing the flow of information, supplies, equipment, and services from manufacturers to distributors to providers of care is especially difficult in clinical supply chains, compared with more technology-intense industries like consumer goods or industrial manufacturing. As supplies move downstream towards hospitals and clinics, the quality and robustness of accompanying management and information systems used to manage these products deteriorates significantly. Technology that provides advanced planning, synchronization, and collaboration upstream at the large supply manufacturers and distributors rarely is used at even the world's larger and more sophisticated hospitals. This article outlines the current state of healthcare supply chain management technologies, addresses potential reasons for the lack of adoption of technologies and provides a roadmap for the evolution of technology for the future. This piece is based on both quantitative and qualitative research assessments of the healthcare supply chain conducted during the last two years."

Woody biomass has a role in sustainable energy transitions, contributing to emissions reduction, economic development, and energy security as a dispatchable resource. This potential is recognized globally, but the woody biomass supply chain has faced technical and social challenges. Smart technologies are increasingly discussed in discourse on supply chain management, such as their potential to improve transparency and efficiency. Despite a variety of research related to woody biomass as well as smart technologies, little attention has been given to integrating the two perspectives. This study explores this intersection by highlighting smart technologies and mechanisms by which they may contribute to overcoming challenges in the woody biomass supply chain, exemplified by the case of Japan. Based on qualitative expert interviews, exploratory results suggest potential of smart technologies that would contribute to addressing both social and technical challenges of woody biomass in Japan. These challenges include transportation infrastructure, biomass quality management, business model integration (cascading), stakeholder relationship management, and local community revitalization and socioeconomic development. This contribution is based on various mechanisms such as improved transparency, information-sharing, accountability, automation, and value maximization. The results of this paper delineate a potential future development path that integrates smart technologies, woody biomass supply chains, and sustainability goals. This is an important further consideration for energy policy in academia, industry, as well as government."

Innovations related to AM supply chains are, so far, insufficiently understood, but their success will require firms’ awareness of their systemic nature and their firm-specific implications. The purpose of this paper is to explore the supply chain innovations dealing with AM in business-to-business supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory qualitative research design is used. Interviews were conducted in 20 firms, workshops were organized to map AM-related processes and activities, and supply chain innovations were analyzed. Findings: This study reveals practical changes in supply chains and requirements for AM-related supply chain innovations. While earlier research has centered on technology or firm-specific AM implementations, this study shows that fully leveraging AM will require innovations at the level of the supply chain, including innovations in business processes, technology and structure, as well as supportive changes in the business environment. These innovations occur in different parts of the AM supply chain and are emphasized differently within different firm types. Research limitations/implications: This research was conducted in one country in the context of the machine building and process industry with a limited data set, which limits the generalizability of the results. The results offer an analytical framework and identify new research avenues for exploring the innovations in partial or complete AM supply chains. Practical implications: The results offer a framework to assess the current state and future needs in AM-related supply chain innovations. Practical ideas are proposed to enhance AM adoption throughout firms’ supply chains. These results are important to managers because they can help them position their firms and guide the activities and collaborations with other firms in the AM supply chain. Originality/value: This study draws attention to the supply chain innovations required when firms adopt AM in their processes. The generic supply chain innovation framework is enhanced by adding the business context as a necessary component. Implementation of AM is shown to depend on the context both at the level of the supply chain and the firm’s unique role in the supply chain. The holistic view taken reveals that successful AM technology adoption requires broad involvement from different firms across the supply chain."

Using transaction-level data from the U.S. Government’s General Services Administration, we study three layers of effects: the Monday Effect, the Technology Effect, and the Product Effect. First, we assess whether performance varies across days of the week in supply chain fulfillment, measured by order cycle time, complete orders fulfilled, and short shipment percentage (i.e., the Monday Effect). Furthermore, we assess how information technology (IT), notably an electronic market, can mitigate such variations (i.e., the Technology Effect), and how product characteristics moderate such effects (i.e., the Product Effect). Our findings show that there indeed exist significant, systematic performance variations across days of the week, with Mondays having poorer performance than other days of the week, after controlling for workload and other factors. Further, we find that much of the performance variation can be reduced when an IT-enabled electronic market is adopted. Specifically, the performance gaps in order cycle time, complete orders fulfilled, and short shipment percentage are reduced by 94%, 71%, and 80%, respectively. We further find that IT improves not only the mean level, but also the variance, of operations performance. Finally, we find that the electronic market is most effective at mitigating the Monday Effect for less frequently transacted products, such as products of high value, products that are slow moving, and specialized products with small numbers of buyers. These findings suggest that measures can be taken to reduce fulfillment deficiencies, including using information systems to mitigate variations in operations management, leading, potentially, to operational continuity and higher service levels in the supply chain."

However, AM requires skilled laborers to operate a machine and post-process manufactured parts. As a result of learning and forgetting phenomena, the manufacturing time would vary when production discontinues for a while. This research proposes a model for a supply chain enabled with AM technology and evaluates the effects of interruptions (e.g., demand fluctuations) on the feasibility of such supply chains. The analyses are extended to quantify how variations in network infrastructures, costs, and production technology could influence investment decisions in favor of AM in supply chains.

It is expected that BT will bring a paradigm shift in the way the transactions are carried in the ASC by reducing the high number of intermediaries, delayed payments and high transaction lead times. India, a developing economy, caters to the food security needs of an ever-growing population and faces many challenges affecting ASC sustainability. It is therefore essential to adopt BT in the ASC to leverage the various benefits. In this study, we identify and establish the relationships between the enablers of BT adoption in ASC. Thirteen enablers were identified from the literature and validated by the experts before applying a combined Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methodology to envision the complex causal relationships between the identified BT enablers. The findings from the study suggest that, among the identified enablers, traceability was the most significant reason for BT implementation in ASC followed by auditability, immutability, and provenance.

Because of the creation and expansion of this global competition among different businesses and companies, many organizations are looking for ways to gain competitive advantage. One of the ways to gain competitive advantage is to focus on the supply chain and improve it. By providing timely, accurate and credible information, information technology improves the performance of the company and its partners in the supply chain. The use of IT tools has affected the supply chain capabilities and subsequently, the supply chain performance is also affected. For this reason, this study examines the impact of information technology on supply chain management. Based on the results of the research, it was determined that the use of information technology in supply chain management increases the quality, reliability and accuracy of information, operational efficiency and improving performance, coherence and collaboration, reducing costs and differentiating products or services."

The current good distribution practice (GDP) guideline demands increased visibility from firms. The purpose of this paper is to propose a solution for SCV enhancements based on automatic identification (Auto-ID) technologies. Design/methodology/approach: The authors qualitatively analyze data from ten case studies of actors in a PSC. A review of Auto-ID technologies supports the derivation of solutions to enhance SCV. Findings: This work shows that the functionalities of Auto-ID technologies offered by current practical monitoring solutions and challenges created by the GDP guideline necessitate further SCV enhancements. To enhance SCV, the authors propose three solutions: securPharm with passive radio frequency identification tags, transport containers with sensor nodes, and an SCV dashboard. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited to a PSC in Germany and is therefore not intended to be exhaustive. Thus, the results serve as a foundation for further analyses. Practical implications: This study provides an overview of the functionality of Auto-ID technologies. In juxtaposition with the influence of the GDP guideline, the use of our Auto-ID-based solutions can help to enhance SCV. Originality/value: This work analyzes a PSC in Germany, with consideration given to the influence of current legislation.

Methodology/approach: Qualitative research is conducted to examine technology-related vendor selection criteria of food retailers in 5 European countries comparing to those in the US. Findings: Our findings show that global food retailers view supply-chain technology as a competitive advantage and is integrated as an important selection criteria; however, selection criteria differ for food-production technology between the United States and the European countries. European food retailers explicitly oppose food-production technology (GMO), while U.S. food retailers implicitly accept food-production technology. Emerging from this opposing view, global food retailers establish similar criteria for organic food (non-GMO) supplier selection: reliability, distance, consistent quality, and relationships with suppliers. Research implications: Applying the supplier choice criteria framework (Lehmann and O'Shaughnessy 1982) to further analyze organic food suppliers, we find that reliability (adaptive criterion), distance (integrative criterion), consistent quality (performance criterion), and relationships with suppliers (economic criterion) are essential, but price is not. Practical implications: This study suggests that to sustain competitiveness in the global food market, food suppliers not only need to ensure technological compatibility in supply-chain, but also adapt to the local food-production restriction (GMO) and organic food selection criteria preferences. Originality/value/contribution: Supply-chain technology is strategically important and is adopted by global food retailers for competitive advantage; yet, there are dramatic differences regarding the acceptance of food production technology. This research contributes to the better understanding of how technologies exert significant and strategic weight in the food supplier selection process. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

In addressing that gap this paper aims to place greening technological and operations initiatives in a supply chain context. In two case studies of automotive companies greening attempts and approaches are assessed in terms of both supply chain practices and relations. It is found that the operations and technological practices in the supply chain are not yet fully developed to realize the strategic approach of greening. Suggestions for further management and research efforts are developed and the impact of greening technology and operations on supply chain relations and challenges are discussed."

This paper uses a specific focus area to empirically validate this assumption. Within the field of third party logistics operations in the supply chain, technology can be expected to be a critical factor in achieving the often targeted expansion of service offerings. The empirical research presented in this paper goes beyond existing material in this field, which remains mostly conceptual, qualitative or descriptive, by targeting statistical generalisation, using findings from a multi-annual survey of transport and logistics service operations in the supply chain. Findings show that existing operational arrangements of transport and logistics service providers mostly remain limited to traditional transport and warehouse services but that technology proves an answer to achieving the targeted expansion of third party operations. Case studies of three innovative service providers are used to develop insights into how technology impacts operational relations in the supply chain and how technology can leverage operations management in a synergistic manner."

In the traditional supply chain finance, the core enterprises with strong competitiveness and a large scale play an irreplaceable role in managing the supply chain information flow, logistics, and capital flow, which results in inequality and information asymmetry. Fraud in supply chain finance is also very serious. To solve the problems of the traditional supply chain finance, in this article, we build a new type of supply chain financial platform that uses blockchain technology to manage the whole process. This supply chain financial platform solves the problem of nontrust among the participants in the supply chain, improves the efficiency of the capital flow and information flow, reduces costs, and provides better financial services to the relevant parties in the supply chain. To protect users' privacy, we propose a new method of using homomorphic encryption in the blockchain to meet the needs of sensitive data privacy protection in supply chain financial scenarios."

Using transaction-level data from the U.S. Government’s General Services Administration, we study three layers of effects: the Monday Effect, the Technology Effect, and the Product Effect. First, we assess whether performance varies across days of the week in supply chain fulfillment, measured by order cycle time, complete orders fulfilled, and short shipment percentage (i.e., the Monday Effect). Furthermore, we assess how information technology (IT), notably an electronic market, can mitigate such variations (i.e., the Technology Effect), and how product characteristics moderate such effects (i.e., the Product Effect). Our findings show that there indeed exist significant, systematic performance variations across days of the week, with Mondays having poorer performance than other days of the week, after controlling for workload and other factors. Further, we find that much of the performance variation can be reduced when an IT-enabled electronic market is adopted. Specifically, the performance gaps in order cycle time, complete orders fulfilled, and short shipment percentage are reduced by 94%, 71%, and 80%, respectively. We further find that IT improves not only the mean level, but also the variance, of operations performance. Finally, we find that the electronic market is most effective at mitigating the Monday Effect for less frequently transacted products, such as products of high value, products that are slow moving, and specialized products with small numbers of buyers. These findings suggest that measures can be taken to reduce fulfillment deficiencies, including using information systems to mitigate variations in operations management, leading, potentially, to operational continuity and higher service levels in the supply chain."

The main objective of sustainable supply chains is to create and maintain long term economic, social, and environmental value for all stakeholders involved in delivering products and services to markets. As sustainability constitutes one of the critical drivers of innovation, the recent emergence of blockchain technology typifies the disruptive impact of digital innovation on supply chain sustainability. Blockchain is a foundational technology that poses a shift in the development of supply chain sustainability. Methods: Despite the increasing importance of blockchain in improving supply chain efficiencies and bringing societal changes, research investigating its potentialities from the lens of sustainability is scarce. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to fill this knowledge gap and synthesize the literature from leading journals on the topic of blockchain and its relation to supply chain sustainability. Papers were collected from different scientific databases and carefully analyzed. The possibilities of blockchains are identified and classified according to the triple bottom line framework, namely the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Results and conclusions: The majority of studies focused on the economic implications of blockchains on supply chains. The sustainable economic aspects of the technology identified in the reviewed literature are mostly the transformational potentials of blockchains and their capabilities to drive new disintermediated business models, higher operational efficiencies, cost advantages, and additional sources of value creation. The social empowerment of supply chains is found through the ability of blockchain to create trustful relationships among supply chain partners, increase food safety, support humanitarian logistics, and promote social equity. Moreover, firms attempting to move forward in their environmental policies and strategies can use blockchain to extend their efforts to improve their environmental practices across the supply chain, reduce the strain on energy and natural resources, and offer environmentally friendly products."

The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of technology (such as blockchain, satellite imaging and others) in improving the veracity and timeliness of SEA in supply chains. We develop conceptualizations of veracity and timeliness appropriate to the SEA context. We also link veracity and timeliness to key steps in the auditing process (data collection, recording and sharing, and analysis and interpretation) and explore technology's role in these steps. We then contrast the traditional audit process to a technology-enhanced audit process and develop an organizing framework to generate a research agenda linking technology-enhanced auditing to veracity and timeliness of the audit process, and, in turn, enhancing social and environmental supply chain performance. The novelty and value of our work lie in its exploration of how technology-enhanced auditing relates to (1) issues related to scope/focus, firm motivations for SEA, and governance of the audit function, (2) three conditions under which the benefits of technology-enhanced audits are most likely, (3) the 4 V's of data (volume, variety, velocity/timeliness and veracity); and (4) possible mechanisms by which veracity and timeliness affect social and environmental performance in the supply chain."

The goal of this paper is to identify boundary conditions for sharing assurance information to improve traceability. Four cases in the food supply chain have been investigated using a template analysis of 16 interviews. Eighteen boundary conditions categorized in business, regulation, quality and traceability categories have been identified. Some boundary conditions were found in all supply chains, whereas others were found to be supply chain specific. Standardization of traceability processes and interfaces, having a joint platform and independent governance were found to be key boundary conditions before blockchain can be used. Our findings imply that supply chain systems have first to be modified and organizational measures need to be taken to fulfill the boundary conditions, before blockchain can be used successfully."

The operator faces a stochastic market demand which depends on technology investment level. The decision variables for the operator are the initial technology investment level and the capacity of the network for each period. The capacity that the operator installs in one period also remains available in subsequent periods. The operator can increase or decrease the available capacity at each period. For this model, an algorithm to find the centralized optimal solution is proposed. A profit sharing contract where firms share both the revenue and operating costs generated throughout the periods along with initial technology investment is suggested. Also a coordinating quantity discount contract where the discount on the price depends on the total installed capacity is designed. The case where the vendor decides on the technology investment level and the operator decides on the capacity of the network is also analyzed and it is shown that this game has a unique Nash equilibrium. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, technology that is adopted by many firms in an industry can shift the basic supply relationship, increasing total production while lowering farm prices. While generally beneficial to consumers, this result can reduce (or completely offset) benefits for farmers, especially late or non-adopters. Our objective is to assess the market dynamics of alternative assumptions about exogenous productivity-enhancing technology adoption by Brazilian dairy farms. Of particular interest is the distributional impact on farm incomes and on the proportion of milk production for different farm size classes. To achieve this objective, we developed an empirical System Dynamics model that evaluates market and farm profitability impacts from 2006 to 2016. We simulated six counterfactual scenarios comprising three rates of adoption (slow, medium and fast) by two farm size categories (small and large). Technology adoption impact differs in the short- and long-term and depending on the assumed rates and farm sizes. Non-adopters of technology can experience lower incomes and a smaller production and income shares when other farms adopt. The underlying causal structure of farm profitability and the herd management decisions suffices to explain the potential market exclusion of non-adopting farms (especially small-scale farms) when others adopt."

This setting incorporates in a unified model the two strategic incentives for the innovator to license to potential competitors for free, i.e., expanding the network size and driving down the wholesale price, thus it enables us to disclose how these two incentives interact with each other to influence the innovator's choice between the internal and external commercialization strategies. Our analyses reveal several interesting results. First, it is beneficial for the innovator to license to the entrant, even for free, when the relative quality of the low-end product provided by the latter is moderate. Second, when the network effects are weak and the quality of the low-end product to introduce is high, the innovator prefers the internal commercialization strategies, while the supplier and the consumers prefer the external commercialization strategy. Third, if licensing fees can be collected, the fixed-fee licensing contract dominates the royalty licensing contract when network effects are strong, or when the entrant is relatively weak. In addition, in the extended models, we point out that our key findings and insights are relatively robust with respect to the market structure in the upstream of the supply chain (monopolistic versus competitive) or the cost structure of the differentiated final products (homogeneous or heterogeneous), but they are somewhat different under alternative wholesale price mechanisms (uniform versus discriminatory)."

Numerical findings prove that SCM can benefit from the outcome of this study even for unreliability. Coordination within SCM can be maintained for a long time by using the proposed recommendations of this study."

Internet of Things (IoT) plays a major role in the twenty-first century global supply chain design, operations and performance. Michael Burkett, managing vice president at Gartner, said: “It’s important to put IoT maturity into perspective, because of the fast pace at which it is emerging, so supply chain strategists need to be looking at its potential now. Supply chain leaders must design their processes to operate in this digital business world”. This includes fulfilling the new expectations of customers and the volatile demands that digital marketing will create. A future supply chain will meet those expectations by converging people, business and things in a digital value network, and incorporating fast-emerging capabilities such as IoT and smart machines into this design strategy[1]. The evolution and changes in ICT are inevitable due to emerging organizational performance objectives and the role of ICT. These include changes in connectivity and access from standalone computing to pervasive ubiquitous computing, wired to wireless connectivity, 24×7 information availability in smart devices, interactive and customizable social network web pages, abundance instant information and self-organizing networks. In terms of decision making, access to the required information is very limited earlier because of the existence of complex models and limited resources to find solutions. However, the recent scenario is exactly opposite with plethora of information and excess resources such as super-computing power with each individuals to deal with complex models. Manpower requirements are also changing from programming to content development and customizing exiting tool with their own creativity. The above changes in connectivity, access, decision making and skilled human power have substantial impact of Information Technology (IT) governance. Success of global IoT supply chain networks depends on how they govern the IT changes and make use of the ICT potential to achieve the latent values in terms of supporting organizational competitiveness. Recent efforts by Tiwana et al. (2013) pointed out potential blind spots in IT and organizational governance based on three dimensions of IT governance cube which includes Who is governed?

Design / Methodology / Approach: This paper proposes a hypothesis model within the decision-making framework that offers strategic alliance tool for managers in the area of supply chain to operationalize business decisions. Samples of more than 210 primary data sets are collected from population of different industries in India by a proper sampling method and by framing questionnaires. The relationship, as proposed in the hypothesis model, is assessed empirically by using statistical techniques called Structural Equation Modeling.  Results: Practitioners may expect improved supply chain performance through strategic alliance between information intensive services and supply chain integration, as it is demanded industries in this Industry 4.0 era. Limitations: The hypothesis framed by western standards seems to be obvious; however, considering the Indian business scenario, where the supply chain and technology of information systems are almost a new concept in most firms, this seems to be a valid area of research. Practical Implications: Research conceptualizes and develops different dimensions of information-intensive services that offer empirical support for the adoption of proper information system to improve performance within an integrated supply chain. Originality / Value: This survey-based empirical research will ‘coordinate and highlight the issue of integration’ of Enterprise Information Systems within the organizational supply chain."

However, AM requires skilled laborers to operate a machine and post-process manufactured parts. As a result of learning and forgetting phenomena, the manufacturing time would vary when production discontinues for a while. This research proposes a model for a supply chain enabled with AM technology and evaluates the effects of interruptions (e.g., demand fluctuations) on the feasibility of such supply chains. The analyses are extended to quantify how variations in network infrastructures, costs, and production technology could influence investment decisions in favor of AM in supply chains. The proposed model is supported by numerical studies to minimize supply chain costs. The research highlights the influence of learning-forgetting on the capacity of AM in supply chains and suggests solutions to mitigate such effects."

The article makes it easier to understand the role of these technologies in the management of the green supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: It was considered of descriptive nature of the quantitative type. The data were collected through a semistructured questionnaire with a sample consisting of 160 Brazilian chemical companies. Processed by structural equation modeling, it generated an empirical theoretical model composed of three main constructs: technology, green supply chain management and environmental performance. Findings: The application of the theoretical empirical model revealed that the technology partially mediates the relationship between green supply chain management and the environmental performance of Brazilian chemical companies. There was evidence that technologies provided tangible competitive advantages, although several of them could only be achieved in the long term. The study suggested implications of theoretical nature, such as having an integrated managerial vision between company and environment; and of practical nature in which new ways of designing products can reduce environmental externalities, often without any technology being used to so."

As the world attempts to navigate through this difficult time, most companies are struggling to maintain a steady flow of required goods and services. Whether it is frozen foods and grocery items (i.e., toilet papers), or ventilators and masks, or even the services (i.e., clinic visits), the supply chain has been facing multiple obstacles. Most models and frameworks built in the extant literature are not been able to capture these disruptions and as such, firms are not having proper strategies to deal with. For firms with complex supply chains (i.e., manufacturing, retailing), it is indeed critical to identify strategies to deal with such a crisis. In this paper, we intend to offer strategic insights in terms of major issues firms are facing and strategic options firms are contemplating. We rely on the twitter data from NASDAQ 100 firms to generate themes regarding the issues faced by the firms and the strategies they are adopting using text analytics tools. We find that firms are facing challenges in terms of demand-supply mismatch, technology, and development of a resilient supply chain. Moreover, moving beyond profitability, firms are experiencing difficulties to construct a sustainable supply chain. We provide futuristic strategic recommendations for the rebuilding of the supply chain."

This paper investigates two supply chain practices (i.e. sourcing practice and delivery practice) and information quality. Scales measuring sourcing practice, delivery practice, and information quality were developed. Four strategic clusters of companies, using alternative supply chain strategies, are identified. In three of the strategic clusters, the level of supply chain practice is consistent with the level of information quality. The fourth strategic cluster has a high level of information quality but a low level of effective supply chain practices. In this study, the fourth strategic cluster performed consistently worse than the other three strategic clusters. The performance measures consist of sales revenue and profitability.

Simultaneously, the moderating effects of uncertainty and the degree of process innovation on the relationship between BSL and supply chain performance are also estimated. The analytical results indicated that proactive technological orientation, information technology (IT) connectivity, supply chain member pressure, and member relationship quality encourage firms to combine their business systems with those of other business partners. Interestingly, in a situation where there is high demand and an uncertain supply, the impact of BSL on supply chain performance is low, while the moderating effect of process innovation on the relationship between BSL and supply chain performance is significant. Finally, it is suggested that firms implementing BSL work to upgrade their technology maintain tight relationships with supply chain partners and create innovation in all aspects of their business processes in order to survive in the highly competitive IT environment."

The supplier in our model has private information about its limited capacity. We compare two models of information. In the first, the supplier observes capacity and reports the capacity to the purchaser in exchange for a purchase commitment. We designate this contract as the “Supply Chain” contract. In the second, the purchaser is directly linked to the supplier's ERP system using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). This linkage avoids information asymmetry. We refer to this contract as the“Full Information” contract. While the Full Information contract is economically more efficient, the supplier would be reticent to agree to this contract. We propose a third contract, which we call the “Hybrid” contract, that awards the purchaser the efficiency gains available in the Full Information contract, but which provides the supplier the same profits as in the Supply Chain contract. The purchaser, however, would still prefer the Full Information contract to the Hybrid contract. We then add an additional dimension to the problem by allowing the supplier to invest in capacity. We find that due to the increased investment under the Hybrid contract, the purchaser may actually prefer the Hybrid contract to the Full Information contract-as long as the information asymmetry is not too great."

This study hypothesized that if blockchain technology correlates with transparency and traceability of SCM, the above limitation can be minimized, as blockchain technology works in a distributed manner. This research uses ""pepper"" as an agri-food domain. The research also recommends that permissioned blockchain is a better fit as compared to permissionless blockchain."

It highlights the contribution of RFID to FSCM, supporting faster logistics activities, with greater products quality, cheaper and with more responsiveness, improving customer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: An inductive theory building approach is used to develop a conceptual model for RFID deployment in the FSCM context. Secondary data analysis from a sample of six companies supports the identification and discussion of the real advantages, disadvantages and barriers felt by companies in a fashion supply chain when RFID technology is introduced. Findings: The logistics activities in the fashion supply chain where RFID technology is most widely deployed are: shipping operations, tracking of raw materials, semi-finished components and finished garments, collecting finished goods, handling processes, tracking containers, tracking products from factory to store, receiving operations, monitoring, and sorting of merchandise. In most cases, the tagging operation is performed at some stage in the production process and tag reading occurs at distribution centres or at stores. The main barrier identified to the deployment of RFID is the problem of interoperability. The costs associated with the technology are the main disadvantage pointed out by the companies. Practical implications: A conceptual framework is proposed exploring the RFID advantages and disadvantages across the fashion supply chain, the main barriers to its introduction and the fashion supply chain logistics activities in which RFID could be found. This represents an important contribution to companies in this industry to become more aware of RFID. Also, new companies which are thinking of introducing this technology could overcome its barriers easily, improving its advantages and minimizing its disadvantages.

However, many ERIs struggle to succeed in technology transfer. This study describes the development of a university technology transfer supply chain network sustainability tool that private and public ERIs can use to become more self-reliant financially. Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are ERIs and are used as a case study. HBCUs lag behind their peer non-HBCUs because historically they have been under-served and were originally established largely as teaching and blue-collar trade schools. Some doctoral HBCUs desire to strengthen their research activities. Systems dynamics is the process of combining the theory, method, and philosophy necessary to analyze the behavior of a system in order to provide a common foundation that can be applied whenever it is desired to understand and influence how things change over time. Applying the systems dynamics approach, a budget resource planning tool was developed using a linear programming optimization technique. This study illustrates that classic industrial uses of linear programming optimization techniques can uniquely be used to optimize budget resource planning for sustainable HBCU supply chain networks and other emerging research institutions. This study contributes to the improved execution of technology transfer projects through better budget resource planning."

However, at present, the implications of vertical strategic interactions for green technology investment in a supply chain are not all that clear. In particular, such a vertical interaction not only can translate into profits between different parties, but usually also involves differentiated environmental performance. A question which arises is: who is the right undertaker for green technology investment in a supply chain, the supplier or retailer? To answer this question, we highlight the implications of vertical strategic interaction for green technology investment in a supply chain. To fill this gap, using a game-theoretic approach, we formulate two models: (a) Model M, in which an upstream manufacturer adopts technologies to meet consumer demand; and (b) Model R, where a retailer integrates environmental concerns into their supply chain decisions. We find that the retailer, who is closer to the customer, is the more effective undertaker for green technology investment, as this not only creates higher profitability for both parties, but also achieves a more sustainable scheme for our environment. When green technologies are invested in by the manufacturer, the double marginalization effect not only may downward-distort their economic performance but can also reduce the equilibrium of product greenness."

Thus, this new application can affect all logistics and supply chain activities positively. The research problem of this paper is to search and assess supply chain changes associated with 3D printing technology adoption to identify the potential impact of AM. To do so, two different supply chain networks, which are TSCN and 3D printing supply chain network (3DPSCN) for healthcare industry are considered. A simulation model is developed to evaluate the potential impact of 3D printing improvements on the configuration of orthopedic insole supply chains. The main contribution of this paper is proposing a simulation model for a healthcare company to compare its 3DPSCN structure with its TSCN version. The results show the concrete benefits such as lead-time and number of customers that can be achieved by 3DPSCN compared to TSCN."

In most business scenarios, the supply chain network is becoming one of the most vital focusing areas. In the supply chain network, blockchain technology is a promising solution for secure information sharing. However, it is a bit critical in maintaining security at each level of the blockchain and hence the public–private–key cryptography is more commonly preferred. This study intends to construct a new privacy preservation model in the field of supply chain networks based on blockchain technology by undergoing three major phases, namely, (a) data sanitization, (b) key generation, and (c) restoration. Further, the sensitive fields in the original data are selected during the data sanitization phase, and in the key generation phase; the optimal key is generated to hide the selected sensitive fields. The hidden data with the secured key is transferred from the source (manufacturer) to destination (vendor) in the supply chain network via the blockchain. The restoration process takes place in the receiver side with the help of the same key. Among all these data flow methods, the optimal key selection is the critical issue that needs to be overridden to make the data transmission secured. As a novelty, a new optimization algorithm referred to as Whale with New Crosspoint-based Update (WNU), which is the advanced version of Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), is developed here to select the optimal key. Finally, the proposed WNU model is analyzed in terms of Hiding Failure (HF) rate, Information Preservation (IP) Rate, and False Rule generation (FR), and Degree of Modification (DM). The proposed secured information sharing in supply chain management (SCM) with blockchain technology will be validated by comparing it over the traditional models in terms of security as well."

Prior studies that analyzed the impact of IT on supply chain performance report results representing the situation of the “average industry.” This research focuses on the automotive industry because of its major importance in many national economies and due to the fact that automotive supply chains do not represent the supply chain of the average industry. Design/methodology/approach: A research model is proposed to examine the relationships between IT capabilities, supply chain capabilities, and supplier performance. The model divides IT capabilities into functional and data capabilities, and supply chain capabilities into internal process excellence and information sharing. Data have been collected from 343 automotive first-tier suppliers. Structural equation modeling with partial least squares is used to analyze the data. Findings: The results suggest that functional capabilities have the greatest impact on internal process excellence, which in turn enhances supplier performance. However, frequent and adequate information sharing also contributes significantly to supplier performance. Data capabilities enable supply chain capabilities through their positive impact on functional capabilities. Practical implications: The findings will help managers to understand the effect of IT implementation on company performance and to decide whether to invest in the expansion of IT capacities.

Yet, there is no adequate understanding of how spillover and cooperation can impact the enterprises' green innovation decisions in the presence of free-rider. Besides, the dynamic impact of green innovation on emission is still lack of attention. We develop a differential game model that explicitly considers a supply chain with two types of manufacturers (i.e., green innovation and free-riding) to examine the dynamics of green innovation. The analysis reveals that under the noncooperation mode, the emissions and profits of free-riding manufacturers are found to be lower than that of innovating manufacturers, but technology spillovers will narrow the gap between them. Under the cooperation mode, there would be greater innovation efforts of green manufacturers and lesser efforts of green suppliers. Moreover, technology spillovers will have less impact on optimal decision changes. The profit of free-riding manufacturers is higher than that of innovating manufacturers, but the initial market power will affect the changes in their sales and profits. Meanwhile, cooperation will increase the total emission amount and long-term profits of the green supply chain, and technology spillovers of green manufacturers will help narrow the emission gap and broaden the profit gap, while that of the suppliers will have the opposite effect. The present study provides a new perspective for research on green innovation decisions for supply chain."

For analyzing the results, Smart PLS software 3 was used by employing the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. The direct effect findings of the study show that supply chain information technology capability (SCIN), supply chain relational capability (SCRC)and supply chain dynamic capabilities (SCDC) have a significant and positive association with the supply chain organizational performance (SCOP) of the pharmaceutical industry of Thailand. On the other hand, the indirect findings show that corporate governance (CG) is significantly moderates on the relationship of SCRC, SCDC and SCOP. Whereas, corporate governance is not significantly moderates in the relationship of SCIN and SCOP. These findings reveal that CG is considered to be a significant moderator because it has significant moderating effect in most of the exogenous variable and SCOP which shows a big contribution of the following study. These findings further could also be support to the managers of the organizations to know about the importance of the SCMC and CG for increasing the SCOP.

Although several studies have investigated the benefits to network leaders from these systems in various industries, little attention has been paid to the delivery of substantial benefits and advantages to its partners. Based on information technology (IT) applications and SCC literature, this paper proposes a model relating partners use of SCMS to benefits. Data from 168 partners using an SCMS implemented by a leading bicycle supply chain in Taiwan to test the hypotheses that SCC and operational performance has a mediating role linking SCMS use in order to affect a partner's performance. The results indicate that SCMS implementation has a significant impact on SCC, which in turn create a significant positive effect on operational (sustainable) performance, ultimately leading to improved growth rate and profitability in partners. Another interesting finding of the research is that SCMS cannot directly affect financial performance. In addition, from sustainable performance aspects, it is revealed that IT enables supply chain management (SCM) to achieve environmental value through information sharing (up and down), process integration (vertical and horizontal) and automation (i.e., planning, operation and control). This finding highlights the importance for maximizing benefits and sustainability for the whole supply-chain partners, the IT implementation must be integrated with the sustainable development goals and inserted in the eco-operation supply-chain platform process. The results also contribute to the debate in prior studies by disclosing why so many partners could not find to gain benefit from these IT implementations. Furthermore, this study represents the first attempt to examine how partners benefit from IT use in SCC for traditional industry."

Moreover, providers also consider forward integration into manufacturing to monetize their intellectual property. We characterize the appropriateness of different business model decisions for markets, which may have varying levels of consumer diversity and competitive intensity at intermediate layers. For the technology provider, our key results show that a subsystem base royalty approach is the optimal business model when dealing with monopolistic intermediaries or having a low degree of consumer diversity. However, a full-system base royalty business model becomes increasingly optimal when the intermediate supply chains face competition and consumer diversity increases. We present conditions under which the technology provider may want to forward integrate. Our formulation and results are relevant to technology providers, policy makers, and industry groups engaged in the prevailing heated global discussion on royalty base."

The growing number of issues related to food safety and contamination risks has established an immense need for effective traceability solution that acts as an essential quality management tool ensuring adequate safety of products in the agricultural supply chain. Blockchain is a disruptive technology that can provide an innovative solution for product traceability in agriculture and food supply chains. Today's agricultural supply chains are complex ecosystem involving several stakeholders making it cumbersome to validate several important criteria such as country of origin, stages in crop development, conformance to quality standards, and monitor yields. In this paper, we propose an approach that leverages the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts efficiently perform business transactions for soybean tracking and traceability across the agricultural supply chain. Our proposed solution eliminates the need for a trusted centralized authority, intermediaries and provides transactions records, enhancing efficiency and safety with high integrity, reliability, and security. The proposed solution focuses on the utilization of smart contracts to govern and control all interactions and transactions among all the participants involved within the supply chain ecosystem. All transactions are recorded and stored in the blockchain's immutable ledger with links to a decentralized file system (IPFS) and thus providing to all a high level of transparency and traceability into the supply chain ecosystem in a secure, trusted, reliable, and efficient manner."

Moreover, the paper analyzes the extent that economic obstacles may cause young small and medium-sized firms to choose different adoptions. Our analysis shows that exporting firms do not tend to conduct embodied backward/forward adoptions, but more likely adopt the embodied backward purchasing. In addition, the impact of competitiveness follows an inverse U-shaped pattern for the embodied backward adoption, but a U-shaped pattern for the disembodied adoption. In terms of market power, there exists an inversed U-shaped pattern for the embodied backward adoption. Under the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) linkages and vertical spillovers, it is found that technology transfer through backward/forward linkages is associated with the embodied ones, whereas a linkage with FDI domestic customers/suppliers is less likely associated with the embodied ones. In addition, under technology transfer, firms facing economic constraints may overcome these by looking for other financial sources and embodied technology transfer. The paper suggests the path for FDI firms, young small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and technology adoption strategies in the future."

The economic performance of the biorefinery supply chain can be increased by, for example, industrial integration to utilise excess heat and products, increasing size to improve economy of scale, and using intermediate upgrading to reduce feedstock transport cost. To enable a large-scale introduction of biorefineries it is important to identify cost efficient supply chain configurations. This work investigates a lignocellulosic biorefinery concept integrated with forest industry, focusing on how different economic conditions affect the preferred supply chain configurations. The technology investigated is black liquor gasification, with and without the addition of pyrolysis liquids to increase production capacity. Primarily, it analyses trade-offs between high biomass conversion efficiency and economy of scale effects, as well as the selection of centralised vs. decentralised supply chain configurations. The results show the economic advantage for biomass efficient configurations, when the biorefinery investment is benefited from an alternative investment credit due to the replacement of current capital-intensive equipment at the host industry. However, the investment credit received heavily influenced the cost of the biorefinery and clearly illustrates the benefit for industrial integration to reduce the cost of biorefineries. There is a benefit for a decentralised supply chain configuration under very high biomass competition. However, for lower biomass competition, site-specific conditions will impact the favourability of either centralised or decentralised supply chain configurations."

Closed-loop supply chains are part of green supply chain management and include traditional forward supply-chain activities as well as additional activities of the reverse supply chain. Extant supply chain literature calls for a chain perspective in order to avoid sub-optimization in the chain since changes at one stage can affect the performance at other stages. The purpose of the paper is to analyze how implementation of green supply chain innovations can enhance value offerings along the supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: This research is based on an explorative, single-embedded case study of a food supply chain. The case is concerned with implementation of green supply chain innovation in terms of biogas technology. The single case comprises four actors in the food supply chain: a retailer, an industrial bakery, a mill, and a farmer. Data collection is based on semi-structured interviews with persons responsible for sustainability in the respective companies. Findings: The case demonstrates that in order to reach the full potential of a green supply chain innovation, the different supply chain actors must be included. What in isolation of one company's perspective is perceived as a waste can be transformed to a value when the problem area is analysed from a chain perspective. Research limitations/implications: The paper is based on a single case study that does not provide static generalizations, and it represents the first step on a road to building new theory about green supply chain innovations. Future research can expand the findings by elaborating upon cases of other types of supply chains and supply chain innovations. Practical implications: The perception of waste in a supply chain can be changed through green supply chain innovations. This case illustrates how obsolete food products at the retail level, which traditionally have been perceived as a waste product with related discarding costs, can be regarded as a valued input by implementation of biogas technology at the industrial bakery company. As a result, other food supply chains can investigate similar solutions. Originality/value: The paper provides a case that visualizes how value offerings along a food supply chain can be chased through green supply chain innovations. Furthermore, the paper applies a supply chain perspective not only conceptually but also empirically. By focusing on the interfaces between each main actor in the supply chain, this paper contributes to existing research with valuable knowledge of inter-organizational issues related to challenges of supply chain innovation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

We examine this issue using data collected from face-to-face interviews with supply chain managers and executives from 1,004 Chinese high-tech electronic component suppliers. The results strongly support the hypothesis that IO cooperation improves a supplier's performance regarding both its major customer and overall marketplace. Relationship learning and IT integration are important mediating variables that drive performance. The strongest effect in our study was the influence of IO cooperation on relationship learning. A unique aspect of this study is that it focuses on a large sample of a specific supplier type—high-tech Chinese suppliers. This, combined with the fact that the sampled companies were involved in manufacturing 13 different product groups, greatly increases the generalizability of the results."

Design/methodology/approach - Based on the relevant literature, this paper analyses the adoption of UCT in SCM operations, and describes the series of shaping processes. These processes are influenced largely by management and technical factors such as strong support from top management and by convenient user interfaces in global ubiquitous computing settings. These two factor types (management and technical) support the formulation of a theoretical framework that can be examined in two national environments (UK and Korea). Findings - The results highlight the key differences in terms of UCT adoption in supply chain contexts between the two national environments examined, and indicate that these differences are affected by the different national industrial foundations, organizational network infrastructures, and perspectives on system development, as well as by issues related to the costs and practical benefits of using this technology in SCM. Practical implications - This study raises some major implications for researchers and practitioners alike. Specifically, the paper stresses the role of management and technical issues in terms of UCT adoption in SCM operations, and expands current theoretical understanding of the subject. It also provides a set of management implications, including the need for managers to have strong support from top management and the need for a convenient user interface.

Then, we depict the polygon of centralized solutions and analyze the impacts of different coordination mechanisms. Our results show that the internal coordination mechanism (e.g., recall cost-sharing con-tract) and external interventions, such as carbon tax policy and TT subsidy policy cannot coordinate the food supply chain. Furthermore, we propose an external intervention – the carbon tax and PT subsidy mechanism, which provides different tax rates or subsidy rates for suppliers and manufacturers, and illustrate its effectiveness in technology investment coordination."

The purpose of this paper is to explore SMEs’ perspectives on the adoption of AM in their specific supply chain positions. The paper develops new knowledge on the challenges SMEs face across the supply chain and the actions they need to promote the adoption of AM. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory interview-based research design is used. In total, 17 interviews were conducted and analyzed in four types of SMEs in their specific positions in AM supply chains. The challenges of adopting AM were mapped, and actions to promote AM adoption were identified. Findings: SMEs in different supply chain positions experience different challenges when adopting AM. Strategic and operative actions are suggested as key solutions to overcome the challenges. The benefits of AM on a large scale will be achieved only if the broader supply chain adopts AM technology and experiences its benefits. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited by its single-country context, its focus on SMEs, and the selection of early-phase AM-adopter firms. The findings imply a need to understand AM adoption as a shared concern and systemic innovation in the supply chain, instead of just a firm-specific implementation task. Practical implications: The findings offer a framework for categorizing AM adoption challenges and propose ways to overcome the challenges of adoption. Originality/value: The study reveals that AM adoption is not only a technology issue, but also an issue of strategic, organizational and operational challenges across the supply chain. It shows that when adopting AM, SMEs face particular challenges and require specific solutions according to their supply chain position."

However, the extent to which GSCM pressures influence GSCM practices, and whether and how GSCM practices affect GSCM performance are topics that remain under-explored. Combining Institutional Theory, Resource-Based View (RBV) Theory, and the literature on GSCM, our study sheds light on the relationship among GSCM pressures, practices, and performance under the moderating effect of quick response (QR) technology. Using statistical analysis of the collected data and case studies from companies in China, we establish several results. First, among different GSCM pressures, market and export pressures have significant impacts on GSCM practices, whereas cost pressure does not influence GSCM practices significantly. Second, internal improvement practice exerts a significant impact on GSCM practices, while external improvement practice negatively affects positive economic performance. In addition, ecology practice has significantly influenced environmental, positive economic, and operational performance. Third, QR technology suppresses the positive effect between internal improvement practice and negative economic performance. Two real cases from Huawei (telecommunications technologies) and Beijing Benz Automotive (automobile manufacturing) are conducted to verify the findings and generate additional insights.

The DL-Tags solution steps into this environment to offer a decentralized, privacy-preserving, and verifiable management of Smart Tags during a product's lifecycle. The solution is based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) and uses the Ethereum blockchain to mediate interactions between the stakeholders during a product's exchange process.

In this paper, we consider a closed-loop supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, a distributor and a third party, who are engaged in producing remanufactured products. Additionally, the manufacturer as the channel leader tends to cooperate with the distributor and the third party by technology licensing. Specifically, we develop three hybrid remanufacturing models: (1) the manufacturer collects and remanufactures used products by herself (Model M), (2) the manufacturer remanufactures a fraction of used products and licenses the distributor to remanufacture while the distributor collects used products (Model MD), (3) the manufacturer remanufactures a fraction of used products and licenses the third party to remanufacture while the third party collects used products (Model MT). We discuss the impacts of remanufacturing ability on the chain members and environmental sustainability, and also analyze the role of saving unit cost in the remanufacturing process. Moreover, we apply the Stackelberg game to attain the equilibrium strategies from the perspective of chain members' profits. The profit of the manufacturer, the distributor and the third party reaches the most in Model M, Model MD and Model MT, respectively.

It typically utilizes corn grain as feedstock in bio-refineries in many countries such as the United States. However, the use of edible matter of crops like corn may lead to a food-versus-fuel competition. To address such an issue, second generation biofuel manufacturing technology using the non-edible matter of crops has been developed. In this paper, the economic viability and environmental sustainability are analyzed and quantified, when restructuring the biofuel supply chain from employing first generation manufacturing technology to the one utilizing second generation technology considering the existing supply chain infrastructure. Two supply chain restructuring strategies, i.e., distributed and centralized preprocessing deployment, are modeled for implementing biomass preprocessing for second generation biofuel manufacturing. Bi-objective optimization formulations for the corn stover-sourced biofuel (a typical second generation biofuel) supply chain considering both economic and environmental aspects are proposed under both strategies. Different decision variables such as the locations selected for constructing preprocessing centers and the corresponding corn stover handling capacities of such centers, as well as the material flows between farms, preprocessing centers, and bio-refinery plants are identified. A case study based on the state of Missouri in the United States is implemented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and analyze the performance of different strategies. The results of the case study show that when corn stover is used as feedstock in bio-refineries, the unit cost of bioethanol production can be reduced, while the unit emission is increased compared to the corn-sourced supply chain under both supply chain restructuring strategies. Specifically, in Missouri where the daily stover handling amount per bio-refinery plant is relatively low and the stover collection radius is relatively small, the centralized strategy outperforms the distributed one with a higher cost reduction and a smaller increase in emissions. It reduces the unit cost by 27.39%, while increasing the unit emission by 24.42%, compared to the corn-sourced supply chain."

We investigate three research questions (RQs): What are blockchain technology's perceived benefits to supply chains, where are disruptions mostly likely to occur and what are the potential challenges to further blockchain diffusion? We conducted in-depth interviews with 14 supply chain experts. Cognitive mapping and narrative analysis were deployed as the two main data analysis techniques to aid our understanding and evaluation of people's cognitive complexity in making sense of blockchain technology. We found that individual experts developed different cognitive structures within their own sensemaking processes. After merging individual cognitive maps into a strategic map, we identified several themes and central concepts that then allowed us to explore potential answers to the three RQs. Our study is among the very few to date to explicitly explore how blockchains may transform supply chain practices. Using the sensemaking approach afforded a deeper understanding of how senior executives diagnose the symptoms evident from blockchains and develop assumptions, expectations and knowledge of the technology, which will then shape their future actions regarding its utilisation. We demonstrate the usefulness of sensemaking theory as an alternative lens in investigating contemporary supply chain phenomena such as blockchains.

And with the rapid emergence of cutting-edge and more disruptive technologies, the OSCM is striving to take advantage of such innovations, but they are bringing in their wake a number of challenges. One of those disruptive technologies is blockchain, which is increasingly accepted in virtually all industries. This study aims to investigate the blockchain technology (BCT) adoption behaviour and possible barriers in the Brazilian OSCM context. We developed a model drawing on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model, the supply chain literature, and the emerging literature on BCT. We empirically validated the proposed model with Brazilian operations and supply chain professionals by using the partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Our findings revealed that facilitating conditions, trust, social influence, and effort expectancy are the most critical constructs that directly affect BCT adoption. Unexpectedly, performance expectancy appeared not decisive in terms of predicting BCT adoption. This study contributes to advancing and stimulating the theory about BCT adoption behaviour in supply chains, as well as important managerial implications, which may be more critical for emerging economies."

Moreover, the techno-economic assessment is evaluated in the context of the supply chain through optimisation. A mixed integer linear program was developed to allow for flexible scenarios in order to determine effects of technological and pre-processing variations on the supply chain. The techno-economic and optimisation model integration was demonstrated on a case study in Scotland using woody biomass, either as sawnlogs or sawmill chips. It was established that sawmill chips is the preferred option, however sawnlogs became competitive once passive drying to 30% moisture content (wet basis) was considered. The flexibility of the modelling approach allowed for consideration of technology savings in the context of the supply chain, which can impact development choices."

In today’s Mach speed business environment, managers often install new technology and expect an agile supply chain when they press. This study reveals the naivety of such an approach, which has allowed new technology to be governed by old processes. Design/methodology/approach: This work takes a qualitative approach to the dynamic conditions surrounding information processing and its connection to supply chain agility through the assessment of 60 exemplar cases. The situational conditions that have created the divide between information processing and supply chain agility are studied. Findings: The agility adaptation typology (AAT) defining three types of adaptations and their mediating constructs is presented. Type 1: information processing, is generally an exercise in synchronization that can be used to support assimilation. Type 2: demand sensing, is where companies are able to incorporate real-time data into everyday processes to better understand demand and move toward a real-time environment. Type 3: supply chain agility, requires fundamentally new thinking in the areas of transformation, mindset and culture. Originality/value: This work describes the reality of today’s struggle to achieve supply chain agility, providing guidelines and testable propositions, and at the same time, avoids “ivory tower prescriptions,” which exclude the real world details from the research process (Meredith, 1993). By including the messy real world details, while difficult to understand and explain, the authors are able to make strides in the AAT toward theory that explains and guides the manager’s everyday reality with all of its messy real world details."

Using data from 205 plants, which were collected in conjunction with the High Performance Manufacturing project, the degree of supplier and customer integration and its match with the implemented IT instruments supporting interorganizational collaboration are investigated empirically. Different types of integration are differentiated from each other with the help of factor, percentile and cluster analyses. The focus and degree of IT integration is measured for each of the resulting groups and the alignment of both aspects is analyzed with the help of an approach referred to as the angles of integration. With respect to supply chain integration and IT implementation, the analysis of different integration strategies shows that most of the plants do not align their IT implementation with their supply chain strategy. The paper helps companies to evaluate the alignment of their use of IT techniques with their global supply chain management emphases. Additionally, possible reasons for a potential missmatch of functional strategies are discussed giving managers insights for dealing more effectively with a strategic alignment. Furthermore, it refines an existing framework for the comparison of different supply chain integration strategies and applies it with IT. Based on the angles of integration, the match of supply chain integration and IT is investigated by statistical analyses. © 2010 Institute for Supply Management, Inc."

However, the pathway to biofuel industry maturity faces unique, unaddressed challenges. To address this challenges, this paper presents an optimization model which quantifies and controls the impact of biomass quality variability on supply chain related decisions and technology selection. We propose a two-stage stochastic programming model and associated efficient solution procedures for solving large-scale problems to (1) better represent the random nature of the biomass quality (defined by moisture and ash contents) in supply chain modeling, and (2) assess the impact of these uncertainties on the supply chain design and planning. The proposed model is then applied to a case study in the state of Tennessee. Results show that high moisture and ash contents negatively impact the unit delivery cost since poor biomass quality requires the addition of quality control activities. Experimental results indicate that supply chain cost could increase as much as 27%–31% when biomass quality is poor. We assess the impact of the biomass quality on the topological supply chain. Our case study indicates that biomass quality impacts supply chain costs; thus, it is important to consider the impact of biomass quality in supply chain design and management decisions."

Using empirical data, we find a domino effect among IT integration, supply chain flexibility, supply chain agility, and competitive business performance. Results from this study indicate that IT integration enables a firm to tap its supply chain flexibility which in turn results in higher supply chain agility and ultimately higher competitive business performance.

We consider the market acceptance uncertainty of key product designs. If a firm decides to implement ex post production strategy (PS), it can delay the production until the market acceptance uncertainty of its product is resolved. Otherwise, ex-ante production strategy (AS) is implemented. We find that, due to the co-opetition, PS does not always benefit either the manufacturer or the OEM, because the value of delayed production is diminished as the competitor may commit a production quantity earlier under AS. Further, firms’ decisions on production timing are dependent on the degree of market acceptance uncertainty of their products and competition intensity. We find that both firms choose PS when uncertainty is high, while only one of them chooses PS when uncertainty is moderate or low. Interestingly, when the competition is intense, the manufacturer tends to choose PS, which can benefit from both the resolved market acceptance uncertainty and OEM’s early commitment of production quantity."

By changing the parameters of this model, we actually adjust the degree of information sharing and create new supply chain configurations. Configurations are the means of responding to events or changes in supply chains in a timely manner. A complete example is used to demonstrate this methodology.

This paper mainly discusses and explores how to create the optimized cooperators and industry sets intelligently in the supply chain network. A mathematical model and a genetic algorithm solving model for cooperator selection and industry assignment in supply chain network are presented to minimize the total delivery delay loss. The mathematical model based on the line balancing technology since the supply chain network can be treated as the extension of assembly production line can be used as a foundation for further practical development in the design of supply chain network. The genetic algorithm solving model is adopted to get a satisfactory near-optimal solution with great speed. The application results in real cases show that the solving model presented by this research can quickly and effectively plan the most suitable type of the cooperators and industry sets in supply chain network. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In many manufacturing industries, technology selection still represents a challenging and not fully understood area, especially when it comes to choosing between competing technologies with similar levels of performance. The methodology employed identified two competing lamination technologies with high levels of development and mechanization: 1) full lamination/solvent type; and 2) dot lamination/solvent free. This was followed by the identification of multiple factors affecting manufacturing technology selection with respect to the supply chain, the use of analytical hierarchy process techniques, and a case study involving site visits and interviews with the senior management of a company operating in the high-functionality textiles industry. The analysis of empirical data gathered from the case study revealed how supply chain related factors are more important than those directly related to the technical merit of the technology such as low-cost manufacturing or automation. The proposed approach has the potential to be transferable to other industries using lamination processes and/or advanced fiber and fabric technology."

A proper decision-making framework and method may be conducive to bridging generic and macro-level sustainability with local-site and task-oriented technology selection, improving the application of sustainable technology. For this reason, a framework is explored to highlight the sustainable nature of relevant components during an operational decision-making process within the supply chain. With an eye to the triple bottom of sustainability, the product chain, value-added activities of supply chain and stakeholders are analyzed and embedded into the technology selection method. The dynamic relationships among these components (product chain, value-added activities and stakeholders) as carriers of technology are also discussed so as to investigate their sustainable features. Furthermore, to figure out the whole technology decision-making logic map, a modified strategic balanced scorecard is established and applied to evaluate technology candidates in terms of their features of sustainability. Next, a computing method is designed to produce a sustainable technology choice. The multilateral mechanisms among the three groups, as well as within each group, during the technology selection process are identified and elaborated completely. The framework of analysis and method presented in the paper add insight to sustainability theoretically, and guide its application in technology adoption. Managerial implications, as well as limitations of this work, are concluded at the end of this paper."

The study made an effort to find out, how different kinds of ISs help the supply chain to achieve greater OP. Three constructs, namely, operational IS, strategic IS and infrastructural IS, have been identified from literature. Four plant-level supply chain constructs, namely, strategic supplier partnership, information sharing and information quality, purchasing management and inventory management, have been identified. The co-relation between ISs, supply chain practices and OP has been tested. Finally, both ISs and supply chain impact on OP have been evaluated. The ISs create an indirect impact on OP via supply chain practices, which results in OP. The OP can be in the form of reduction in number of defects in operations, quality improvement in products, delivery of products or raw material at right place, at right time and in right quantity. The study leads to interesting implications for practitioners. The ISs should be connected at various levels, that is, operational, strategic and infrastructural, to support the entire supply chain. With the changing dynamics of accuracy and speed in operations and the target of achieving economies of scale, the role of ISs becomes critical in the entire supply chain.

Irrigation, therefore, has a crucial role in enhancing food security and reducing hunger in the region. Numerous countries in Africa consider water and irrigation management as a key factor in improving their food security and ensuring access to drinking-water for their populations. Fortunately, there is evidence from a number of places on the continent where the adoption of efficient irrigation systems has led to higher productivity among smallholder farmers. While the appropriate interventions for the diverse agro-ecological zones of sub-Saharan Africa are known, adoption among smallholder farmers still remains a challenge. Digital technology opens the vast untapped potential for farmers, investors, and entrepreneurs to improve the efficiency of food production and consumption in Africa. From precision farming to an efficient food supply chain, technology could bring major economic, social, and environmental benefits. Increasing investment and involvement of the private sector is crucial for the up-scaling of irrigation technologies. Indeed, the sheer optimism across the startup ecosystem is that extreme hunger can be cured in Africa, in this generation, by significantly transforming the industry that employs most of its citizens.

Majority of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. As a strategy to reduce child mortality, the Government of Malawi, in 2008, initiated integrated community case management allowing health surveillance assistants (HSAs) to treat sick children in communities. Malawi however, faces health infrastructure challenges, including weak supply chain systems leading to low product availability. A baseline assessment conducted in 2010 identified data visibility, transport and motivation of HSAs as challenges to continuous product availability. The project designed a mHealth tool as part of two interventions to address these challenges. Methods A mobile health (mHealth) technology - cStock, for reporting on community stock data - was designed and implemented as an integral component of Enhanced Management (EM) and Efficient Product Transport (EPT) interventions. We developed a feasibility and acceptability framework to evaluate the effectiveness and predict the likelihood of scalability and ownership of the interventions. Mixed methods were used to conduct baseline and follow up assessments in May 2010 and February 2013, respectively. Routine monitoring data on community stock level reports, from cStock, were used to analyze supply chain performance over 18-month period in the intervention groups. Results Mean stock reporting rate by HSA was 94% in EM group (n = 393) and 79% in EPT group (n = 253); mean reporting completeness was 85% and 65%, respectively. Lead time for HSA drug resupply over the 18-month period was, on average, 12.8 days in EM and 26.4 days in EPT, and mean stock out rate for 6 tracer products was significantly lower in EM compared to EPT group. Conclusions Results demonstrate that cStock was feasible and acceptable to test users in Malawi, and that based on comparison with the EPT group, the team component of the EM group was an essential pairing with cStock to achieve the best possible supply chain performance and supply reliability. Establishing multi-level teams serves to connect HSAs with decision makers at higher levels of the health system, align objectives, clarify roles and promote trust and collaboration, thereby promoting country ownership and scalability of a cStock- like system."

We first find the buyer entry can increase the incumbent buyer's incentive to conduct the technology upgrade: if the production cost is high as well as the investment cost is low in the scenario without technology spillover, he will upgrade the production technology to a higher level after the buyer entry. At such level of the upgraded technology, the incumbent buyer is better off in the market with entry, contrary to conventional belief that the entry likely hurts the existing firm. Moreover, our research reveals that upgrading the suppler's production technology can, in turn, influence the buyer entry and further the concentration of the product market. Without technology upgrade or with that but in the absence of technology spillover, the entrant buyer will be fed by the supplier, resulting in a successful entry and thereby a competitive market. However, when technology upgrade occurs along with technology spillover, supplying products to the entrant buyer will be refused by the supplier under a high production cost and a low investment cost, incurring her entry failure and thus the market monopoly."

The purpose of this paper is to suggest a pathway for closing the gap between supply chain resilience research and efforts in industry to develop a more resilient supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: Based upon virtual roundtables with supply chain executives, supplemented with interviews and publicly available datapoints about COVID-19 impact on the supply chain, we explore challenges in industry and suggest opportunity areas where research can support efforts in industry to improve supply chain resilience. Findings: During the COVID-19 crisis, participating supply chain executives are experiencing textbook supply, demand and control risks in the supply chain. They also observe a lack of preparedness, shortcomings of current response plans and the need for greater supply chain resilience. Focus areas in improving resilience mirror generic recommendations from literature and provide a rich opportunity to reduce the gap between research findings and efforts in industry. Research limitations/implications: More empirical, event-based and less conceptual research into supply chain resilience has been called for several times during the last two decades. COVID-19 provides a very rich opportunity for researchers to conduct the type of research that has been called for. This research may contribute to the structurally de-risking of supply chains. Areas of research opportunity include decision models for supply chain design that avoid overfocusing on costs only, and that consider the value of flexibility, short response times and multiple sources as well as methods for enriching supplier segmentation and evaluation models to reduce a focus on savings and payment terms only. Practical implications: Key levers for de-risking the supply chain include the need to balance global sourcing with nearshore and local sourcing, the adoption of multiple sources and a greater utilization of information technology to drive more complete and immediate information availability. Perhaps most importantly, talent management in supply chain management needs to promote a focus not just on costs, but also on resilience as well as on learning from current events to improve decision-making. Social implications: There is a great opportunity for supply chain managers to grow their contribution to society beyond risk response into the proactive reduction of risks for the future. Researchers can serve society by informing this progress with impactful research. Originality/value: This article offers initial empirical exploration of supply chain risks experienced in the context of COVID-19 and approaches considered in industry to improve supply chain resilience. Opportunities for empirical, event-based and less conceptual research that has been called for years, are identified. This research can help close the gap between supply chain resilience research and efforts in industry to improve supply chain resilience. Hopefully the research opportunities identified can inspire the flurry of research that can be expected in response to the multiple special issues planned by journals in our field."

Network-DEA models using radial measures of efficiency have been used to address supply chain performance evaluation problems. However, such models applied to bank supply chains are found to have potentially three disadvantages. First, they do not consider bank supply chains’ undesirable outputs. Second, existing studies frequently omit the impact of the heterogeneity of production technologies across different bank supply chain systems. Third, Network-DEA models fail to deconstruct the latent improvement sources of performance, thus unable to support adequately decision makers’ policy targets. To address these issues, this paper proposes two alternative network-DEA models which incorporate the directional distance function (DDF) and meta-frontier methods for evaluating bank supply chain system performance. The main characteristic of the proposed models is that they take intrinsic technology-level differences between different supply chains into account. To measure the technology levels of different types of bank supply chain systems, this paper proposes a technology gap ratio (TGR) index. A case study of 16 Chinese commercial banks from 2007 to 2014 is presented to exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed network-DEA models and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed TGR index to the supply chain performance evaluation problem in the bank industry. Empirical results show that the deposit/loan efficiency of Chinese banks is still relatively low. The managerial and technological factors cause Chinese banks’ deposit/loan inefficiency. Specific suggestions are also proposed for each type of banks."

We set two conditions for establishing complementarity: (i) one type of strategic integration must positively influence the adoption of another and (ii) the two types of strategic integration must exhibit a synergistic fit with respect to manufacturing plant capabilities. We test these conditions using survey results representing 224 manufacturing plants. The findings show positive complementarities between PPT integration and supplier integration with respect to quality, delivery, and process flexibility. Also, positive complementarities exist between PPT integration and customer integration with respect to quality and new product flexibility.

Specifically, we model a domestic firm's use of a selective offshore strategy (i. e., offshoring only a portion of its information technology activities) to exploit, through IT investments or contractual provisions, the foreign vendor's large, scale-driven repository of production knowledge. We illustrate the conditions under which knowledge transfers during offshoring may reduce a domestic firm's in-house production costs, leading to total cost savings in both the short term and the long term. Alternatively, when knowledge transfers are not sufficiently large, some short-lived offshoring projects may generate substantial cost savings to the domestic firm; however, long-lived offshoring projects may cause a disruption in the knowledge supply chain, resulting in substantial losses in the later stages of the project. A firm that fails to realize the costs associated with such a disruption soon enough in the project life may find itself locked into a disadvantageous offshoring agreement without any recourse. However, a domestic firm may be able to overcome a disruption in its knowledge supply chain by exploiting the learning-by-doing production knowledge generated by the foreign vendor's economies of scale. The managerial implications derived from our learning model may help guide firms as they consider the impacts of offshore contracts and knowledge management investments on firm knowledge, production costs, and coordination costs."

The supply chain consists of one supplier and one retailer, in which the RFID tag price is shared between the supplier and the retailer. We present and compare the performance differences between a wholesale price contract and a consignment contract when the retailer is the Stackelberg leader and the supplier is the follower. Based on the optimal pricing and inventory decisions, an interesting observation of contract selection is that there are two critical values of inventory available rate such that when the inventory availability is less than the lower value, both the supplier and the retailer prefer a consignment contract; when the inventory availability is greater than the upper value, a wholesale price contract is their best choice; when the inventory availability is between the two values, the supplier prefers a wholesale price contract and the retailer prefers a consignment contract. Additionally, there exist threshold values of RFID tag price and sharing rate to determine the contract preference for the retailer. Furthermore, the profits of both the supplier and the retailer are independent of the RFID tag price sharing rate in a wholesale price contract, and the supplier has the incentive to invest in RFID tag cost in a consignment contract."

This technology has already been used in a significant number of supply chain due diligence initiatives across different sectors with varying degrees of success. The implementation of these initiatives has exposed some challenges when applying blockchain technology. These include: a lack of control over the quality of information initially entered into the system; challenges in access by vulnerable groups, affected communities, and informal supply chain actors; a lack of scalability and incentives for uptake; the emergence of multiple databases for different supply chains; and a lack of interoperability for various systems. However, blockchain- based supply chain initiatives have also shown there are benefits which can be realised for supply chains if these challenges are overcome. Such benefits include the resistance to modification of data; greater efficiency for up-to-the-minute data analysis; as well as providing a structure to enable greater trust between organisations linked across increasingly complex global supply chains."

Its most popular application thus far is in payment system applications, e.g., bitcoin. This disruptive technology is expected to contribute significant business value to multiple industry sectors, including supply chain management (SCM), where it can provide greater visibility, accountability and trust in interorganizational business collaboration. In this article, we review some fundamental concepts of Hyperledger Fabric, one of the most mature permissioned blockchain implementations. Further, we use the context of a food supply chain to highlight key design and implementation challenges for blockchain, and provide a strategic assessment of its prospects. Our aim is to dispel misguided notions and myths about blockchain as a silver bullet for all businesses. We believe it is important to penetrate the hype to allow a more realistic understanding of this technology. Blockchain is a high-cost, high-overhead storage medium. It is viable only when its higher cost is counterbalanced by the set of benefits that are identified by a careful and thorough analysis of the business. Thus, it will be used mainly for storing important data related to interorganizational transactions among partners where trust is lacking and provenance and visibility are critical. Our paper offers enterprises a systematic way to understand the real costs and risks of blockchain adoption. The insights gained in the SCM context also apply to other areas such as financial services and healthcare that could leverage the full potential of blockchain technology."

Technological learning curves have been commonly used as a tool to understand technological change as a function of cumulative production. Traditional learning curve approaches, however, do not distinguish the direct and upstream, supply chain technological changes by which cost reductions are achieved. While recent advances in learning curves have focused on distinguishing the different physical and economic drivers of learning, forecasted technological changes have not been applied to estimate the potential changes in the environmental performance of a technology. This article illustrates how distinguishing the different effects of technological learning throughout the supply chain can help assess the changing costs, environmental impacts and natural resource implications of technologies as they develop. We propose a mathematical framework to distinguish the effects of learning on the direct inputs to a technology from the effects of learning on value added, and we incorporate those effects throughout the supply chain of a technology using a life cycle assessment (LCA) framework. An example for cadmium telluride (CdTe) photovoltaics (PV) illustrates how the proposed framework can be implemented. Results show that that life cycle GHG emissions can decrease at least 40% and costs can decrease at least 50% as cumulative production of CdTe reaches 100 GW. Technological learning in supply chain processes can further reduce emissions and costs by up to 1-2%. Lastly, we discuss the implications of using this new technological learning framework in the long-term assessment of the costs, environmental impacts and resource requirements of technologies using life-cycle assessment."

However, these studies have not explained how the IT-based supply chain achieves this superior performance. This study aims to reveal some of the mediating influences at play: the new product development (NPD) activities of product launch, product innovativeness and product development capability. Design/methodology/approach: Taking the electronics manufacturer’s perspective, this study took a resource-based view to propose that NPD activities are affected by IT advancement and that IT-based supply chain architecture is a critical resource that ultimately affects new product performance. Thus study focuses on product launch, because this is the most expensive and risky stage of NPD; product innovativeness, because it plays a substantial role in achieving a competitive advantage; and product development capability, because it leads to superior product performance. A questionnaire was used to collect data from managers of projects, products and supply chains of computer and communication electronics manufacturers; 235 valid questionnaires were returned. These data were subsequently analyzed using a variety of statistical methods. Findings: The results support that manufacturers’ IT resources enable them to enhance NPD activities effectively with their suppliers, and that NPD activities play a key role in moderating the relationship between IT-based supply chains and new product performance. Originality/value: This paper provides an empirically tested model of how IT-based supply chain architecture can lead to superior new product performance through product lean launch, product innovativeness and product development capability."

While the basic model is general, this study is motivated by several cases of inter-organizational technology adoption in supply chains. The proposed model in this study considers firms on both levels of the supply chain, namely, supplier firms and buyer firms. These individual firms' thresholds for adoption should be considered by other firms' decisions within a network, together with their own organizational attributes. The heterogeneity across the population should be allowed. That is, individual firms make a decision for adopting the technology at different times due to their different network sizes, prior beliefs, and amounts of information observed. The main finding is that this uncertainty decreases as other suppliers adopt the technology, and information about their experiences becomes available. In addition, at any given time, an estimate of the benefit to a supplier depends on the number of supplier firms and on the number of buyer firms that have already adopted the technology. Thus, we seek to capture this dependence and analyze its effect on the adoption of a new inter-organizational technology. The next step is to embed the firm-level adoption model into a population model. The model includes various types of heterogeneity in the population model to capture the factors affecting the speed of diffusion. This allows us to derive an adoption curve that is specified by the accumulated fraction of firms that have adopted the technology in or before any given period. The population model allows us to consider the effect of several strategies observed in practice and numerical experiments yielding many managerial implications in this area."

A plethora of supply chain traceability solutions based on blockchain has been proposed recently. However, current systems are limited to tracing simple goods that have not been part of the manufacturing process. We recommend a method that allows for the traceability of manufactured goods, including their components. Products are represented using non-fungible digital tokens that are created on a blockchain for each batch of manufactured products. To create a link between a product and the components that are needed to produce it, we propose “token recipes” that define the amount of tokenized goods required for minting a new token. As input tokens are automatically and transparently consumed when creating a product token, the physical process of producing a new item out of existing components is projected onto the ledger. This ultimately leads to the complete traceability of goods, including the origin of inputs. Evaluating the performance of the system, we show that a prototypical implementation for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) scales linearly with the amount of the input and goods tracked."

The problem is often described in terms of technology readiness levels, with the particular challenge relating to the stages between proof of concept and initial adoption in the factory environment. In the United Kingdom, the government has established the High Value Manufacturing Catapult, a network of manufacturing innovation centres brought together with the objective of addressing the so-called valley of death between traditional academic research and industrial needs across a broad spectrum of manufacturing process technology. This is achieved through demonstrating manufacturing technology at full scale, in factory representative environments in terms of equipment, process control and operation. This provision helps to address the key gap of full-scale pre-production capability demonstration and can be seen to de-risk investment in new manufacturing technology. This article argues that addressing this particular gap is entirely necessary but not sufficient to drive exploitation of the full potential that is available from the latest manufacturing technologies. A three-dimensional maturity-based framework is proposed, which, in addition to considerations of technology demonstration, also allows the position of the target product application in its product lifecycle and the readiness of the supply chain to receive the technology to be taken into account as success factors in the potential for industrialisation. Case study examples, both current and historical, are used to illustrate the need for such an approach in achieving future technology-enabled supply chains. In combination, this analysis introduces the basis of a more complete ‘long valley of death’ description which articulates the needs of research networks to establish a level of foundational capability ahead of specific client readiness projects in order to maximise overall pace and achieve a level of agility of delivery which is consistent with future views on digitalisation of manufacture."

Signaling through inventory being only tenable when inventory transactions are verifiable at low enough cost, we then turn our attention to how this verifiability can be achieved in practice and argue that blockchain technology could enable it more efficiently than traditional monitoring mechanisms. To demonstrate, we develop b verify, an open-source blockchain protocol that leverages Bitcoin to provide supply chain transparency at scale and in a cost effective way. The paper identifies an important benefit of blockchain adoption-by opening a window of transparency into a firm's supply chain, blockchain technology furnishes the ability to secure favorable financing terms at lower signaling costs.

Design/methodology/approach: A workshop with managers was organized to empirically explore blockchain adoption levels and focus areas in the supply chain, as well as drivers and barriers of implementation. Findings: Workshop participants reported that adoption of blockchain in the supply chain today is very limited but actively considered by many. Drivers for this consideration include achieving greater transparency and visibility, as well as, improving processes and reducing costs. Participants identify many barriers, including a lack of understanding of costs and benefits of blockchain in the supply chain. Interestingly, participants report less concern about the feasibility of the technology implying managerial consideration if progressing beyond the technology and into the potential adoption of it. As a result, participants may be moving beyond the hype surrounding blockchain and giving consideration to the many remaining questions. A working technology does not yet mean that there is a feasible supply chain adoption. As a result, it may be too early to tell whether blockchain will be a disruptive technology. This paper identifies several fruitful areas for further consideration by management and in research. Originality/value: As there is little empirical research on blockchain in the supply chain, this paper moves beyond use-case development and the exploration of pilot cases and studies how companies may consider supply chain adoption beyond the pilot and the early development of blockchain. Although only offering an initial exploration, this paper uncovers progress being reported in industry and many areas where further consideration and research can help advance thinking and practice."

Specifically, the paper examines the extent to which task uncertainty, environmental uncertainty, and inter-organizational uncertainty affect intention to adopt cloud computing technology and how information processing capability may moderate these relationships. The paper uses a multiple method approach, thus examining the hypothesized model with both quantitative and qualitative methods. To begin, the paper incorporates a Delphi study as a way in which to choose a practically relevant characterization of the moderating variable, information processing capability. The authors then use a survey method and hierarchical linear regression to quantitatively test their hypotheses. Finally, the authors employ interviews to gather additional qualitative data, which they examine via use of content analysis in order to provide additional insight into the tenability of the proposed model. The quantitative analysis suggests that significant two-way interactions exist between each independent variable and the moderating variable; each of these interactions is significantly related to intention to adopt cloud computing. The qualitative results support the assertion that information processing requirements and information processing capability affect intention to adopt cloud computing. These findings support the relationships addressed in the hypothesized model and suggest that the decision to adopt cloud computing is based upon complex circumstances. This research is limited by the use of single key informants for both the quantitative and qualitative portions of the study. Nonetheless, this study enhances understanding of electronic supply chain management systems, and specifically cloud computing, through the application of organizational information processing theory. The authors’ mixed-methods approach allowed them to draw more substantive conclusions; the findings provide a theoretical and empirical foundation for future research in this area, and also suggest the use of additional theoretical perspectives. This study provides insight that can help supply chain managers to better understand how requirements, when coupled with capabilities, may influence the decision to adopt cloud computing as an enabler of supply chain management systems.

Instead, there exists a critical interval in the number of manufacturing partners in which manufacturers regularly choose certain evolutionary stable strategies all the time.

In this work, a general modeling framework conceived to steer decision-making regarding the strategic design and systematic planning of advanced biorefining supply networks is presented. The design task is formulated as a mixed integer linear program which accounts for the maximization of the supply chain profit, considering multiechelon, multiperiod, multifeedstock, and multiproduct aspects as well as spatially explicit features. The applicability of the proposed model, along with the use of a bilevel decomposition approach, are demonstrated with a case study of lignocellulose-based biorefining production systems in the South-West of Hungary. Results show the effectiveness of the tool in the decision-making regarding the systematic design of advanced biorefining SC networks. An economic analysis of different design configurations (i.e., centralized and distributed scenarios) through a holistic evaluation of the entire biobased SC, integrating technology superstructure, shows that both instances generate profitable investment decisions that could be equally trusted by the decision-maker unless regional restrictions are applied."

Under the layer audit signature, the order is sent to the supplier, the information exchange is carried out in the MVC mode, and the integrated framework of the information organization and procurement system under cross-border e-commerce is designed through the MVC mode. This paper takes the electronic commerce simulation system as the framework and the virtual image technology as the basis to study the key technology of updating massive terrain data in real time under the condition of general computer hardware. Using the XP (Extreme Programming) programming method in the agile development mode, the development efficiency and quality are effectively improved. The design process uses UML and Visio to establish requirements and system design, simulates geographic information with virtual image technology, and provides real-time traffic scene graphic image information. The system takes the order process as the main line, realizes the system under the network environment, realizes the integration of internal and external supply chains, and solves the drawbacks of high information level and large amount of information at the bottom of traditional procurement activities.

The obtained results show that the GTI made by manufacturers follow high threshold and low threshold. The generalized dual-credit system increases both thresholds and promotes the transition from Case O to Case B and Case B to Case G. The transition is sensitive to standard energy consumption per-unit (SECP), green credit quota (GCQ), and price of green credit (PGC). The generalized dual-credit system benefits the manufacturers who exceed the low threshold, vice versa, especially for whose conventional product with lower initial energy consumption per unit.

We model the problem as a tri-echelon, capacitated facility location problem that decides on the location of plants and warehouses, their capacity and technology planning, the assignment of commodities to plants and the flow of commodities to warehouses and customer zones. We use a mixed-integer programming formulation strengthened by valid but redundant constraints and apply Lagrangean relaxation to decompose the problem by echelon. Lagrangean relaxation provides a lower bound that is calculated using an interior-point cutting plane method. Feasible solutions are generated using a primal heuristic that uses the solution of the subproblems. Unlike common practice in the literature, the decomposition does not aim at getting easy subproblems, but rather at getting subproblems that preserve most of the characteristics of the original problem. Not only does this provide a sharp lower bound but also leads to a simple and efficient primal heuristic. We can afford to have relatively difficult subproblems because the interior-point cutting plane method used to solve the Lagrangean dual makes clever and selective choices of the Lagrangean multipliers leading to fewer calls to the subproblems. Computational results indicate the efficiency of the approach in providing a sharp bound and in generating feasible solutions that are of high quality."

Exploring these questions can contribute knowledge to the field of operations management: how firms can employ their IT capabilities for operations and supply chain management, the impact of competitive and institutional environments on IT-based operations strategy; the relationships between IT-enabled supply chain practices and operations performance. This paper addresses these aspects by examining the factors affecting Chinese firms' adoption of IT-enabled supply chain operations and the benefits they achieve, by drawing from and integrating the resource-based and institutional theoretic perspectives. It identifies key organizational and institutional factors that influence firms' technology adoption for supply chain management. Results show that firms can benefit by incorporating the technology within their internal operations processes and by using the technology externally with partners in their supply chain trading community. The results provide evidence that firms' IT engagement for operations and supply chain management is significantly influenced by institutional factors. Association analysis was conducted to understand the potential influence of external diffusion on internal assimilation. The result supports the theoretical claim.

Waste recovery is dependent on the creation of connections along the supply chain, so that actors with goods at risk of becoming waste can transfer them to those who may be able to use them as inputs or for their own consumption. Such waste recovery is, however, often hampered by what we call ‘circularity holes’, i.e., missing linkages between waste generators and potential receivers. A new type of actor, the digital platform organization, has recently taken on a brokerage function to bridge circularity holes, particularly in the food supply chain. Yet, extant literature has overlooked this novel type of brokerage that exploits digital technology for the transfer and recovery of discarded resources between supply chain actors. Our study investigates this actor, conceptualized as a ‘circularity broker’, and thus unites network research and circular supply chain research. Focusing on the food supply chain, we adopt an interpretive inductive theory-building approach to uncover how platform organizations foster the recovery of waste by bridging circularity holes. We identify and explicate six brokerage roles, i.e., connecting, informing, protecting, mobilizing, integrating and measuring, and discuss them in relation to extant literature, highlighting novelties compared to earlier studies. The final section reflects on contributions, implications, limitations and areas for further research."

In the present scenario, the SMEs are under huge pressure to achieve the supply chain competitive advantage and to improve operation and logistic effectiveness and, at the same time, remain tractable to the demand uncertainty and volatility in the market. To enhance the performance of supply chain in SMEs, the managers need to identify the internal as well as the external factors that affect the supply chain performance of SMEs in India. They need to understand the causal relationship of these factors. Design/methodology/approach – There may be a number of factors that are critical for achieving acceptable supply chain performance, and these factors have been identified by principal component analysis (PCA). In all, 29 factors have been identified by using PCA and the dominating 29 factors are categorized into 6 constructs, and finally, the structural equation modelling (SEM) methodology using the AMOS 4.0 program has been adopted as the primary methodology for this paper to assess the causal relationship among six constructs. Findings – In this paper, the authors analyzed the structural relations among information technology (IT), logistic effectiveness, operational effectiveness, customer relationship, supplier relationship and SCM competitive advantage. Results indicate that IT holds the key to achieve the SCM competitive advantage in SCM practices of SMEs in India. Research limitations/implications – The proposed models for enabling factors are tested in firms with a limited numbers of factors in highly competitive environment. More factors may be incorporated, which will help for a clear understanding and establishing the causal relationship among the various enabling factors. Practical implications – Although managers of Indian SMEs are aware of various enabling factors, a systematic approach is required for identifying enabling factors, and as these factors may have complex interrelation between them for analyzing supply chain performance in SMEs, it is essential that such an approach is in place. The paper presented here will help the SMEs managers in identifying the areas in which they need to focus their attention to improve SCM practices. A structural equation modelling is developed to show the complex relationship between the factors that affect the performance. In addition to that, the proposed structural equation model acts as a good guideline to improve the performance of the supply chain in India. Originality/value – The paper provides a structural equation model to develop a map of the causal relationships and magnitude among identified enabling factors."

Product deletion, rationalization, or reduction research is limited, yet it is a critical strategic issue for multiple reasons. Supply chain information governance excellence is critical to this strategic issue. Product deletion decision making usually follows a multi-staged process including recognition, analysis and revitalization, evaluation and decision formation, and implementation. Each stage requires critical information and data support for sound decision making. Failure in information governance including generating, understanding, and accuracy can prove risky for product deletion.

A quasi-experiment was designed in the form of pretest-posttest non-equivalent group. Total 67 students were chosen from two secondary schools in Johor, Malaysia. About 35 of them were assigned as experimental group that would receive treatment in SRLE while 32 of them were assigned as control group with no treatment given. Technology-based statistical reasoning tasks were utilized during the treatment. Meanwhile, the pretest and posttest were administered to all students in both groups before and after the treatment. The data obtained was analyzed using two-way mixed design ANOVA and one-way ANOVA. The findings showed that statistical reasoning ability of students who had been exposed to SRLE was better than students in the control group. There was no considerable discrepancy on the statistical reasoning ability of students who was exposed to SRLE with regard to the chosen four constructs. To conclude, SRLE has great positive impact on students' statistical reasoning ability in this study."

Pharmaceutical supply chains in particular are one example of fragmented information flows among supply chain participants. Pharmaceutical supply chain processes have a crucial influence on medication quality and ultimate patient outcomes. When manufacturing problems arise, temperature control cannot be maintained throughout the supply chain, counterfeit medications enter the supply chain, containers are damaged or sensitive medication is improperly transported and stored, the drugs' effectiveness can be affected and this can result in serious consequences, including patient sickens or even death. In this paper, we analyze Radio Frequency Identification Technology (RFID), a technology that can improve communication of data and information, reduce counterfeiting, and enable monitoring of drug quality in pharmaceutical supply chains. The study is conducted in the context of an RFID platform implemented in Germany. The paper extends and complements previous studies by analyzing the RFID implementation and business value in an end-to-end supply chain process across multiple stakeholders in the pharmaceutical supply chain, from the manufacturer via the wholesaler to pharmacies and hospitals.

The basic model emphasizes how time on feed, feed density and biosecurity choices interact, as well as how these choices respond to (i) input prices, and (ii) attributes regarding animal productivity parameters that might be influenced by policy choices such as animal welfare strictures and restraints on use of medication. We show that ostensibly substituting inputs in protecting against animal health risks may in fact be complements, and that the model's production choices come as a complementary package. We then extend the model to endogenize the choice of animal genetics. A finding is that innovations in general infrastructure encourage herd owners to choose more feed efficient, but less hardy, animals. Higher feed conversion efficiency then induces the use of denser feed rations, accelerated finishing and greater levels of biosecurity actions at farm perimeters. Our theory provides a coherent framework for explaining associations among inputs and outcomes that are linked with confined animal agriculture. It also explains how animal protein supply chain technology adoption and performance can differ according to a region's state of infrastructure, why responses to a change in infrastructure may be large, and why public sector efforts to reduce production risk may beget private sector effort to do so."

Trust is a multidimensional intangible concept without clear agreement of what it constitutes, and its meaning get even more confused in a supply chain management (SCM) context. The purpose of this paper is to understand how applying BCT in SCM can influence trust. In the literature, there are some findings that address trust and BCT but they are very scattered, only some related to SCM but many related to financial applications. Thus, our method used is a systematic literature review, based on a conceptual framework of trust we developed. We discovered a great gap in linking trust (and related theories) to BCT applications in SCM. This paper gave insights on the reciprocal nature of trust as well as the influence of applying BCT in SCM. In current literature, trust is highly expected as a consequence for BCT if we are considering trust in the technology. At the same time, trust is highly expected to be an antecedent for applying BCT in terms of trust in SC partners represented by openness of information sharing.

Now days the E-supply chain for serving food items is getting very popular because of ease and facilities provided by Food Delivery Apps (FDAs) like Swiggy, Zomato and Uber Eats etc. Use of FDAs has caused variation in demand of food items and subsequently has caused an impact on bullwhip effect. Bullwhip effect is a supply chain phenomenon, which is defined as amplification of demand, as information in form of orders moves from lower echelon to higher echelon of supply chain. This paper attempts to explore the influence of E-supply chain on demand of food items and hence on the bullwhip effect, in food industry, in Indian context. In practice, E-supply chain causes price variations and results in poor forecasts and hence enhances bullwhip effect. But in present scenario, it has been demonstrated that the application of IT will contribute to the reduction of bullwhip effect in long run. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, it has been proved that due to better information sharing the bullwhip effect has been reduced which generally increases in case of E-supply chain."

It consists of a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model which integrates several interconnected decisions: facility location and capacity determination; supplier selection and purchase levels definition; technology selection and allocation; transportation network definition including both unimodal and intermodal options; supply planning; product recovery and remanufacturing. The three pillars of sustainability are addressed as objective functions: economic, through Net Present Value; environmental through the Life Cycle Analysis methodology ReCiPe; and social through a developed GDP-based metric. Uncertainty is considered using a stochastic ToBloOM. This applied to a case of a European based company with markets in Europe and South America. This work contributes to the literature by building on several identified research gaps such as the need for an integrated approach that allows simultaneous assessment of different interacting supply chain decisions, the need to explicitly assess the environmental impact in closed-loop supply chains, the need to assess the impact of supply chains on society, and the need for a multi-objective tool that includes all the three pillars of sustainability. Strategies towards a more sustainable supply chain are also derived from this work."

A total of 250 questionnaires were distributed to manufacturing companies located in Penang, which is in the northern region of Malaysia. Applying multiple regression analysis, the study indicated that a higher level of supply chain partner commitment leads to a higher level of supply chain reliability and flexibility. Trust among supply chain partners also contributes to improving supply chain flexibility. The study focused only on inter-organisational relationships. Future research should examine how both inter- and intra-organisational collaboration impact supply chain performance. Although researchers have recognised that IT is an enabler of supply chain management (SCM) activities, there has been limited research that has directly associated the usage of IT and partner relationships to supply chain performance. This research is essential in order to ascertain the impact of IT usage and partner relationships on improving supply chain performance, particularly in the Malaysian manufacturing environment."

Rather than relying on centralized intermediaries (e.g., banks) this technology allows two parties to transact directly using duplicate, linked ledgers called blockchains. This makes transactions considerably more transparent than those provided by centralized systems. As a result, transactions are executed without relying on explicit trust [of a third party], but on the distributed trust based on the consensus of the network (i.e., other blockchain users). Applying this technology to improve supply chain transparency has many possibilities. Every product has a long and storied history. However, much of this history is presently obscured. Often, when negative practices are exposed, they quickly escalate to scandalous, and financially crippling proportions. There are many recent examples, such as the exposure of child labor upstream in the manufacturing process and the unethical use of rainforest resources. Blockchain may bring supply chain transparency to a new level, but presently academic and managerial adoption of blockchain technologies is limited by our understanding. To address this issue, this research uses the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and the concept of technology innovation adoption as a foundational framework for supply chain traceability. A conceptual model is developed and the research culminates with supply chain implications of blockchain that are inspired by theory and literature review."

According to the characteristics, the potency of deterioration and cross contamination along the chain will be a challenge for every actor in tuna supply chain, to provide tuna product with the best quality and safe to consume. One of the tool to ensure the standard safety and quality is doing traceability system along tuna supply chain. It is very crucial because every actor in chain has a responsibility to ensure food safety and quality through handling, manufacturing, packaging, and transporting the product. The critical point that should be covered by traceability system in tuna supply chain includes temperature, content of histamine, quantity of TPC, and contents of bacterial pathogens like Salmonella, and the sanitation for workers, equipment and processing room. The Information Technology (IT) based tuna traceability system is proposed and discussed in this paper to optimizing the traceability system in tuna supply chain. This paper discusses the development of a traceability system architecture and prototype for tuna supply chains. The developed system prototype shows the functional capabilities required for backward and forward tracing of tuna fish transformation and movement along the chain involving many actors (from fishing vessels to retailers). The system also permits the monitoring of processes and products based on microbiological analysis and on existing SOPs owned by some actors in a tuna supply chain. The implementation issues are also described in this paper."

The consideration factors are deliberately drawn from a variety of different, yet related, theories and are grouped into an extensive Technology-Organization -Environment (TOE) framework. In accordance with the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method, the decision framework was analyzed for appropriateness through surveys of selected experts in the semiconductor industry. Because the semiconductor industry has a long history of heavy resource usage and has proven an early advocate of green supply chains, results from this study can provide insights to other firms with similar operations and aims. The contributions of this research are twofold. First, its theoretical contribution consists of integrating previously separate strands of different theories into a holistic framework and exploring the causal relationships among decision factors. Second, its practical contribution lies in its establishment of a strategic path that provides firms a set of priorities when adopting green supply chains."

This suggests a potential for emissions reductions through improved accessibility to efficient technologies. This paper estimates an upper-bound CO2 emission mitigation potential that could theoretically be achieved by improved access to efficient technologies in industrial sectors. We develop a linear optimization framework that facilitates the exchange of sectoral production technologies based on the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), assuming perfect substitutability of technologies and homogeneity within economic sectors, while ignoring barriers to technological adoption and price driven adjustments. We consider the full global supply chain network and multiple upstream production inputs in addition to energy demand. In contrast to existing literature our framework allows to consider supply chain effects of technology replacements. We use our model to calculate emission reduction potentials for varying levels of access to technology. If best practice technologies were made available globally, CO2 emissions could theoretically be reduced by more than 10 gigatons (Gt). In fact, even second-tier production technologies would create significant global reduction potentials. We decompose sectoral emission reductions to identify contributions by changes in energy intensity, supply chain effects and changes in carbon intensities. Excluding the latter, we find that considering supply chain effects increases total mitigation potentials by 14%. The largest CO2 emission reduction potentials are found for a small set of developing countries."

Tracking any commodity is a tedious job and requires a lot of manual attention. The existing system uses a centralised database system to track a commodity. Blockchain is a decentralised, immutable ledger managed by a cluster of computers. The very nature of blockchain makes it suitable technology for traceability in a supply chain. Blockchain creates immutable records. Once a transaction is stored in the blockchain, it is impossible to tamper it illegally. This immutability of blockchain builds trust among the participants that conduct business in a lack of trust environment. Using consensus protocols, blockchain builds trust between the various participants. Blockchain provides traceability since immutable records are added in blockchain; it is easy to track the source of the product. This paper illustrates the Application of Blockchain in Agri-Food Supply Chain. It unfolds how blockchain technology can be integrated to an Agri Supply Chain and improves the traceability. This integration enables companies to quickly track unsafe products back to their source and see where else they have been distributed. This integration can result to prevent illness and save lives, as well as reduce the cost of product recalls."

Early research shows that blockchain might be an enabler for the supply chain management. However, little is known about how blockchain might improve information sharing for complex, multitier supply chains. Therefore, this article aims at analyzing how and to what extent blockchain can facilitate information sharing for vendor managed inventory by designing a software prototype based on Hyperledger Fabric using the design science research approach.

Prior studies show that Industry 4.0 adoption majorly influences the sustainability aspects in a supply chain network. The purpose of this paper is to identify the Industry 4.0 enablers of supply chain sustainability and further attempt to propose a research framework to bridge the theoretical gaps. Design/methodology/approach: In this research study, the authors have used a systematic literature review methodology in the field of Industry 4.0 and sustainable supply chain management. The list of papers was downloaded from Scopus (www.scopus.com) database. Through strict screening, only journal papers were selected for conducting the review of the literature. Findings: The review brings out some interesting findings which will be helpful for the research community. There have been limited research in the area of managing supply chain network sustainability through Industry 4.0 technologies. The authors found only 10 papers out of a total of 53 papers which emphasize on smart manufacturing, smart production system, smart warehouse management system, smart logistics and sustainability. Most of the previous research studies have ignored the social aspects of supply chain sustainability. Finally, the authors identified 13 key enablers of Industry 4.0 playing an important role in driving supply chain sustainability. Practical implications: The strategies for Industry 4.0 should be refined and detailed to develop economic and social systems that can act flexibly to sudden changes in the system. Top management must be convinced for prioritizing investment support and creating a system that can facilitate technology convergence. Managers must also act on new models of employment and frame plans to continuously improve the system. In addition, managers must focus on establishing a collaborative platform to facilitate high-tech research and developments. Finally, it is essential to develop a performance management system for monitoring all actions in the supply chain network.

This new operational practice motivates us to investigate the effects of carbon emission reduction on a supply chain with one manufacturer and two competing retailers for deteriorating products under VMI, which has not been fully studied in the existing literature. Carbon cap-and-trade regulation and investment in green technologies are used to curb carbon emissions generated by production and inventory holding in this system. To bench mark the performance of the decentralized system, an optimization model for the centralized system is formulated to show that there exists an upper bound on the profit penalty for decentralization and the carbon emissions of the centralized system may be lower than those of the decentralized system. A revenue-sharing contract is then proposed to improve the profit and emissions of the decentralized system. The results show that the supply chain can be coordinated perfectly when the demand depends on the manufacturer's green technology level and two competing retailers’ selling prices. Numerical examples with sensitivity analysis are further provided to test the robustness of the supply chain's operational decisions."

Senior managers from purchasing, manufacturing, and logistics were targeted in the mail survey. The break down by channel category interviews is as follows: 14 retailers, 13 finished goods assemblers, 12 first-tier suppliers, three lower-tier suppliers, and nine service providers. Findings - Customer satisfaction and service is perceived as more enduring than cost savings. All managers recognize technology, information, and measurement systems as major barriers to successful supply chain collaboration. However, the people issues - such as culture, trust, aversion to change, and willingness to collaborate - are more intractable. People are the key bridge to successful collaborative innovation and should therefore not be overlooked as companies invest in supply chain enablers such as technology, information, and measurement systems. Research limitations/implications - The average mail-survey response rate was relatively low: 23.5 percent. The case study analyses were not consistent in frequency across channel functions. Although the majority of companies interviewed and surveyed were international, all surveys and interviews were managers based in the US. Practical implications - This study provides new insight into understanding the success and hindering factors of supply chain management. The extensive literature review, the cross-channel analysis, and case studies provide academics and managers a macro picture of the goals, challenges, and strategies for implementing supply chain management. Originality/value - This paper uses triangulation methodology for examining key issues of supply chain management at multiple levels within the supply chain. "" Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

The purpose of this research is to evaluate the potential impact of additive manufacturing improvements on the configuration of spare parts supply chains. This goal has been accomplished through scenario modeling of a real-life spare parts supply chain in the aeronautics industry. The spare parts supply chain of the F-18 Super Hornet fighter jet was selected as the case study because the air-cooling ducts of the environmental control system are produced using AM technology. In total, four scenarios are investigated that vary the supply chain configurations and additive manufacturing machine specifications. The reference scenario is based on the spare parts supplier's current practice and the possible future decentralization of production and likely improvements in AM technology. Total operating cost, including downtime cost, is used to compare the scenarios. We found that using current AM technology, centralized production is clearly the preferable supply chain configuration in the case example. However, distributed spare parts production becomes practical as AM machines become less capital intensive, more autonomous and offer shorter production cycles. This investigation provides guidance for the development of additive manufacturing machines and their possible deployment in spare parts supply chains. This study contributes to the emerging literature on AM deployment in supply chains with a real-world case setting and scenario model illustrating the cost trade-offs and critical requirements for technology development. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

In such a context, Blockchain is a decentralized certificate authority that may provide economic and operational benefits but companies operating in a supply chain claim to have little knowledge about Blockchain due to its novelty and to the lack of use cases and application studies. In this work, a software connector has been designed and developed to connect an Ethereum-like blockchain with the enterprises’ information systems to allow companies to share information with their partners with different levels of visibility and to check data authenticity, integrity and invariability over time through the blockchain, thus building trust. In order to explore the potential of deploying the blockchain in a supply chain, a simulation model has been developed to recreate the supply chain operations and integrated with the blockchain through the same software connector to carry out a scenario statistical analysis. Application results shows how blockchain technology is a convenient instrument to overcome collaboration and trust issues in a supply chain, to increase the supply chain overall performance, to minimize the negative consequences of information asymmetry over the echelons of a supply chain but also to discourage companies from any misconduct (e.g. counterfeiting data or low data accuracy)."

The objective of this study is therefore to develop a distributed ledger-based blockchain approach for monitoring supply chain performance and optimising both emission levels and operational costs in a synchronised fashion, producing a better outcome for the supply chain. We propose the blockchain approach for different production allocation problems within a multi-echelon supply chain (MESC) under a carbon taxation policy. As such, we couple recent advances in digitalisation of operations with increasingly stringent regulatory environmental policies. Specifically, with lead time considerations under emission rate constraints (imposed by a carbon taxation policy), we simultaneously consider the production, distribution and inventory control decisions in a production allocation-based MESC problem. The problem is then formulated as a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) model. We show that the distributed ledger-based blockchain approach minimises both total cost and carbon emissions. We then validate the feasibility of the proposed approach by comparing the results with a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II).

However, the impact of 3D printing on operations and firm relationships in a supply chain is relatively unexplored in academic research. A unique aspect of 3D printers is that they can be installed at the retailer in a supply chain, a characteristic that we highlight in our paper since it enables the supply chain to be more responsive to demand. Consequently, 3D printers can be adopted by either the manufacturer or, in a more novel situation, the retailer; we analyze the equilibrium of Stackelberg games in both cases. We characterize the economic and competitive conditions where either firm adopts 3D printing, and show that under either scenario, it is possible for both firms to earn more profit than a benchmark system without 3D printing. We identify and quantify the positive benefits associated with 3D printing, for both firms in a simple supply chain, when either firm adopts this new manufacturing technology. In many cases, the scenario where the manufacturer adopts 3D printing and installs 3D printers at the retailer results in the best profit outcomes for the manufacturer. The retailer's preference, however, depends on problem parameters. Therefore, supply chain managers should carefully consider the possibility of 3D printing products in their supply chain."

Design/methodology/approach: Hierarchical regression models were developed to test the hypothesized relationships. In particular, data were obtained from only independent restaurant owners and managers because of their ability to select and determine their own suppliers. Findings: Results revealed that restaurant autonomy from suppliers has a more positive effect on market responsiveness than supplier dependence. The moderating test results revealed that information technology adoption significantly improved the relationships between restaurant dependence and market responsiveness, while exhibiting no significant moderating effect. Restaurant trust in suppliers significantly improved the positive effect of autonomy upon market responsiveness; however, it had no significant moderating effect on this link.

Using theoretical arguments from the knowledge-based view, we compare the effects of these four strategies on product novelty and product financial performance. Moderated structural equation modeling is used to test the hypotheses, based on survey responses of 267 projects, partially complemented by archival objective data. Results suggest that some strategies are more effective for enhancing product novelty, while others are more beneficial for improving product financial performance. Furthermore, this study reveals no distinction between supply chain and non-supply-chain sources’ influences on product novelty. We also show that technology interdependence carries a significant role in enhancing the positive association between product novelty on product financial performance. Overall, this study demonstrates companies need to carefully design their inter-organizational NPD strategies to suit various needs of innovation projects."

WELS recognized the importance of both freezing process and storage conditions (especially water activity) for maintaining a high product quality. His group laid the foundation for a better understanding of water sorption in food materials. In fact, their critical evaluation of the BET theory initiated fruitful discussions on water sorption in foods. Their work on freezing included studies on crystal growth conditions, the impact of Time-Temperature conditions in the Frozen Food Chain (FFC), the development of various Time-Temperature Indicators and the use of antifreeze proteins in frozen food production. They actually developed the “mother” of all electronic Time-Temperature Recorders; that was an electronic temperature data-logger used for the analysis of product temperatures and residence times in the FFC. The techniques they developed in their studies of the crystallization process allowed the WELS group to develop an osmotic dehydration cell attached to a Confocal Scanning Laser Microscope (CSLM). This arrangement allowed them to understand and accurately describe the mass transfer process at cellular level during osmotic dehydration. Throughout his productive scientific career Prof. Spiess coordinated several European research cooperation projects that were instrumental in the development of a European Network of Food Science/Engineering Institutions and a true “European Food Science community”."

It is shown that cooperative investment strategy benefits the manufacturer but damages the profits of the retailer and the whole supply chain. A revenue sharing and cooperative investment contract, which combines revenue sharing and cost sharing mechanisms, is thus designed to coordinate the supply chain. Numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis of the equilibrium strategies and coordinating results on key system parameters are given to verify the effectiveness of the contract, and meanwhile get some managerial insights.

This article examines the critical issues at each sub-system of agriculture supply chain, starting from the input to the consumer, with a view to integrating them in efficient and effective manner. As proper flow of information across the chain constitutes an integral part, the role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in improving supply chain efficiency in agriculture is discussed in detail. Thus, this article broadly covers some of the important aspects of agriculture supply chain in India—identification of issues at different levels in the supply chain; transformation in agriculture due to various supply chain interventions; the role of ICTs in supply chain management (SCM)—and the suggestion to improve efficiency at different levels in the supply chain. There is a wide research gap in this sector; having such potential and prospect for overall growth, not much research has been done in this field.

Their decision makers brought to balance economic performance with environmental and social issues. Methods and concepts for jointly optimizing economic, environmental and social cost of operations in supply chains are challenging. Decision support systems could help organizations to support sustainability in their supply chains. A collaborative decision-making framework for sustainable supply chain planning is proposed in this paper. This framework facilitates the development of multi-party collaborative relationships across a network to improve the sustainability of delivered products. It supports a new Information and Communication Technology (ICT)system platform. The platform provides insight for infrastructure and visibility to support supply chain sustainability requirements. The proposed decision support system proposes simultaneously collaboration and sustainability functionalities missing in many existing supply chain planning systems. This system has been evaluated and validated through a pilot program across a range of food supply networks. The work is motivated and applied by a major European research program in the agri-food supply chain."

The focus of these wearable computers in earlier studies has been on consumers and technical aspects, and their application has not been explored from an organizational perspective. This means that the recent introduction of wearable technology has great potential, which is untapped in the organizational context, especially for supply chain collaboration (SC). In this study, wearable technology is thought to offer huge potential for organizations in SC. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to empirically examine the role of wearable technology i.e. Smartwatch in enhancing collaboration among supply chain members with mediating roles of green training (GT) and emotional intelligence (EI). The population of this study is the pharmaceutical industry in Pakistan. Simple random sampling method has been used to collect data from 150 sample size. Data have been collected through offline and online survey method. Data have been analyzed through partial least square-structure equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. The results of this study have empirically tested the established conceptual framework. Continuance intention to use smartwatch has a positive effect on SC. Furthermore, GT and EI have mediating roles between continuance intention to use smartwatch and SC. It is concluded that the continuance intention to use smartwatch will increase SC. GT and EI will strengthen the relationship between continuance intention to use smartwatch and SC. The use of wearable technology will motivate employees to communicate rapidly and to monitor their supply chain activities using web-based and other applications.

In the present scenario, the SMEs are under huge pressure to achieve the supply chain competitive advantage and to improve operation and logistic effectiveness and, at the same time, remain tractable to the demand uncertainty and volatility in the market. To enhance the performance of supply chain in SMEs, the managers need to identify the internal as well as the external factors that affect the supply chain performance of SMEs in India. They need to understand the causal relationship of these factors. Design/methodology/approach – There may be a number of factors that are critical for achieving acceptable supply chain performance, and these factors have been identified by principal component analysis (PCA). In all, 29 factors have been identified by using PCA and the dominating 29 factors are categorized into 6 constructs, and finally, the structural equation modelling (SEM) methodology using the AMOS 4.0 program has been adopted as the primary methodology for this paper to assess the causal relationship among six constructs. Findings – In this paper, the authors analyzed the structural relations among information technology (IT), logistic effectiveness, operational effectiveness, customer relationship, supplier relationship and SCM competitive advantage. Results indicate that IT holds the key to achieve the SCM competitive advantage in SCM practices of SMEs in India. Research limitations/implications – The proposed models for enabling factors are tested in firms with a limited numbers of factors in highly competitive environment. More factors may be incorporated, which will help for a clear understanding and establishing the causal relationship among the various enabling factors. Practical implications – Although managers of Indian SMEs are aware of various enabling factors, a systematic approach is required for identifying enabling factors, and as these factors may have complex interrelation between them for analyzing supply chain performance in SMEs, it is essential that such an approach is in place. The paper presented here will help the SMEs managers in identifying the areas in which they need to focus their attention to improve SCM practices. A structural equation modelling is developed to show the complex relationship between the factors that affect the performance. In addition to that, the proposed structural equation model acts as a good guideline to improve the performance of the supply chain in India. Originality/value – The paper provides a structural equation model to develop a map of the causal relationships and magnitude among identified enabling factors."

Traditional supply chains rely on banks to support the related financing activities and services. With the emergence of blockchain technology, more and more companies in different industries have considered using it to support supply chain finance. In this paper, we study supply chain financing problems in supply chains selling fashionable products. Modeling under the standard newsvendor problem setting with a single manufacturer and a single retailer employing a revenue sharing contract, we develop analytical models for both the traditional and blockchain-supported supply chains. We derive the optimal contracting and quantity decisions in each supply chain with Nash bargaining between the manufacturer and retailer. We analytically show how the revenue sharing contract can coordinate both types of supply chains. We then compare the optimal systems performances between the two supply chains. We prove that the blockchain-supported supply chain incurs a lower level of operational risk than the traditional supply chain. We have shown that if the service fees by banks are sufficiently high, adopting blockchain technology is a mean-risk dominating policy which brings a higher expected profit and a lower risk for the supply chain and its members. For robustness checking, we examine other commonly seen supply chain contracts and alternative risk measures, and analytically reveal that the results remain valid."

Five main classification categories are used in this paper: technology, supply chain management, research methodology, application industries, and social aspects. The paper then focuses on the category of supply chain management and reviews 1187 articles that were published between 2000 and 2015 in rated journals. All the papers reviewed are further classified into eight subclasses under this category of supply chain management. The review yields useful insights into the anatomy of RFID literature in supply chain management, enhances evidence-based knowledge, and contributes to informing practice, policymaking and future research. The review reveals that even presently, despite technical and cost challenges, enormous potential exists for the application of RFID in several areas of supply chain management and the prospects are likely to grow into the future. Since RFID solutions have emerged primarily over only the past 20 years, significant research opportunities exist and would need to be addressed to continue to support the technology’s maturation, evaluation, adoption, implementation, and diffusion."

The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to be an initial effort towards bridging the existing knowledge gap in the literature. Design/methodology/approach – This exploratory research was conducted in one retail supply chain. A multi-method approach combining a longitudinal real-life case study and a methodology integrating several steps, including a “living laboratory” strategy was used and involved all members of a product line to analyze their contributing activities and their interface with other supply chain members; the aim being to explore the impact of RFID technology on inter-and intra-organizational processes and information systems. Findings – The results provide support to the role ofRFID as enabler of better integration of timeliness and accuracy data flows into information systems, business process optimization through automation, better system-to-system communication and better inter-and-intra-organizational business process integration. Furthermore, they also validate the unique characteristics of RFID technology such as enabler of real-time multiple tags items data collection and exchange within the supply chain and the read-and-write capability that may help, for example, to reuse some RFID tags within the supply chain and therefore reduce the cost related to the purchase of the said RFID tags. Finally, the study also reveals the importance of business process renovation and complementary investments during the adoption of RFID technology, in order to achieve high level of business value from the technology. Originality/value – The paper is original in the sense that it provides some empirical support for the enabling role of RFID technology in allowing supply chain integration.

To overcome these problems the supply chains must be more smarter. For establishing a large-scale of smart infrastructure to merge data, information, products, physical objects and all processes of supply chain, we applies the internet of things (IOT) in supply chain management (SCM) through building a smart and secure system of SCM. We have prepared a website for suppliers and managers. We tracked the flow of products at each stage in supply chain management through the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. Each product attached with RFID tag and scanned through RFID reader and ESP8266 at each phase of supply chain management. After scanning the tag we stores tag id in the database. All information about products will be entered by suppliers and then uploaded to managers. In our system the supplier and manager gets perfect information of the entire life cycle of goods, and this will achieve transparency of supply chain management. For assessing security criteria of proposed system of supply chain management, we also proposed a framework which integrates neutrosophic Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (N-DEMATEL) technique with analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The neutrosophic Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (N-DEMATEL) technique is utilized to infer cause and effect interrelationships among criteria of smart supply chain security requirements. Depending on obtained information from (N-DEMATEL) the neutrosophic AHP is utilized to calculate weight of criteria and sub-criteria. Then the integrated framework will help researchers and practitioners to design secure system of supply chains. We presented DEMATEL and AHP in neutrosophic environment to deal effectively with vague, uncertain and incomplete information. So the proposed system of supply chain management will be able to overcome all challenges of traditional SCM and provide secure environment of SCM processes."

Increased use of information technology introduces a number of cybersecurity risks affecting cyber-resilience of the supply chain, both in terms of the product or service delivered to a customer and supply chain operation. The situation is complicated by factors such as the global sourcing of technology components or software, ownership of the systems in a supply chain, different legal jurisdictions involved, and the extensive use of third parties to deliver critical functionality. This article examines the cyber-resilience issues related to the supply of products, services, and the supply chain infrastructure considering the nature of threats and vulnerabilities and the attributes of cybersecurity. In doing so, it applies a model for cybersecurity that is adapted from the Parkerian hexad to explore the security and trustworthiness facets of supply chain operations that may impact cyber-resilience.

Only when trust from the digital domain is extended to the physical domain can the movement of goods be accurately traced (e.g., for callbacks and provenance) and product authenticity determined.

Diverse research methods are used to conduct a three-dimensional analysis of MPIRs and major project supply chains (MPSCs) transverse, cutting, and in a hoop. The results suggest that infectious risks in the MPSC system are periodic. Based on the propagation speed, pressure, and direction, the infectious risk propagation capability and propagation energy distribution can be identified. The MPSC can be decomposed into N interactive subsystems. The infectious risks of various subsystems within the load scope should be diffused and coordinated in time. The theory helps in identifying risks and strategies speciﬁc to the decision major projects’ risk category. The research is demonstrated through an experiment study conducted in major projects' supply chain involving interviews, questionnaires, field observations and focus group meetings through case comparison and simulation study in the supply chain of major projects. In addition, the research can not only prevent major project infection risks (MPIRs) but also ensure the orderly production of major projects."

In fact, the increasing level of connectivity is transforming supply chains, and it creates new opportunities but also new risks in the cyber space. Hence, cyber supply chain risk management (CSCRM) is emerging as a new management construct. The ultimate aim is to help organizations in understanding and improving the CSCRM process and cyber resilience in their supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: This research relied on a qualitative approach based on a comparative case study analysis involving five large multinational companies with headquarters, or branches, in the UK. Findings: Results highlight the importance for CSCRM to shift the viewpoint from the traditional focus on companies’ internal information technology (IT) infrastructure, able to “firewall themselves” only, to the whole supply chain with a cross-functional approach; initiatives for CSCRM are mainly adopted to “respond” and “recover” without a well-rounded approach to supply chain resilience for a long-term capacity to adapt to changes according to an evolutionary approach. Initiatives are adopted at a firm/dyadic level, and a network perspective is missing. Research limitations/implications: This paper extends the current theory on cyber and information risks in supply chains, as a combination of supply chain risk management and resilience, and information risk management. It provides an analysis and classification of cyber and information risks, sources of risks and initiatives to managing them according to a supply chain perspective, along with an investigation of their adoption across the supply chain. It also studies how the concept of resilience has been deployed in the CSCRM process by companies. By laying the first empirical foundations of the subject, this study stimulates further research on the challenges and drivers of initiatives and coordination mechanisms for CSCRM at a supply chain network level. Practical implications: Results invite companies to break the “silos” of their activities in CSCRM, embracing the whole supply chain network for better resilience. The adoption of IT security initiatives should be combined with organisational ones and extended beyond the dyad. Where applicable, initiatives should be bi-directional to involve supply chain partners, remove the typical isolation in the CSCRM process and leverage the value of information. Decisions on investments in CSCRM should involve also supply chain managers according to a holistic approach. Originality/value: A supply chain perspective in the existing scientific contributions is missing in the management of cyber and information risk. This is one of the first empirical studies dealing with this interdisciplinary subject, focusing on risks that are now very high in the companies’ agenda, but still overlooked. It contributes to theory on information risk because it addresses cyber and information risks in massively connected supply chains through a holistic approach that includes technology, people and processes at an extended level that goes beyond the dyad."

In spite of their initiatives to achieve ASC for improving their organizational performance, barring a few large companies, the medium and small size manufacturing companies have not yet been able to adopt and design supply chains which lead to ASC. This may be due to various challenges in the process of achieving agility. Also, the published literature in this area is very scanty. Therefore, to fill this gap, the purpose of this study is to determine the mediating role of Information Sharing Strategy (ISS) on Agile Supply Chain (ASC) practices for achieving Supply Chain Performance (SCP) in medium size manufacturing companies in UAE. An empirical survey of supply chain managers in UAE is conducted for this purpose. It is found that information sharing plays a major mediating role in ASC to achieve superior supply chain performance."

The Health Research Funding organization reported that in developing countries, nearly 10-30% of the drugs are fake. Counterfeiting is not the main issue itself, but, rather, the fact that, as compared to traditional drugs, these counterfeit drugs produce different side effects to human health. According to WHO, around 30% of the total medicine sold in Africa, Asia, and Latin America is counterfeit. This is the major worldwide problem, and the situation is worse in developing countries, where one out of every 10 medicines are either fake or do not follow drug regulations. The rise of Internet pharmacies has made it more difficult to standardize drug safety. It is difficult to detect counterfeits because these drugs pass through different complex distributed networks, thus forming opportunities for counterfeits to enter the authentic supply chain. The safety of the pharmaceutical supply chain has become a major concern for public health, which is a collective process. In this paper, we propose a novel drug supply chain management using Hyperledger Fabric based on blockchain technology to handle secure drug supply chain records. The proposed system solves this problem by conducting drug record transactions on a blockchain to create a smart healthcare ecosystem with a drug supply chain. A smart contract is launched to give time-limited access to electronic drug records and also patient electronic health records. We also carried out a number of experiments in order to demonstrate the usability and efficiency of the designed platform. Finally, we used Hyperledger Caliper as a benchmarking tool to conduct the performance of the designed system in terms of transactions per second, transaction latency, and resource utilization."

The use of RFID in the supply chain is an emerging technology that has attracted a lot of attention in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Major retailers in various continents have given mandates to their suppliers to adopt the technology in order to continue business with them. As a result, there appears to be a shift in power dependency in the supply chain. This has had an impact on how the suppliers adopt RFID to embrace the mandates. The impact is likely to have a long term effect on current business models. Our study into the existing literature reveals three tiers of the effects of mandates. The effects are best examined by separating out the suppliers into two groups: suppliers adopting the technology under the mandates and suppliers not affected by the mandates and adopted a wait-and-see tactic.

This research also explores the impact of top management support (TMS) on the relationship between ITU and SCI. Based on data collected from 220 manufacturing firms, this study indicates that ITU will have a positive impact on the success of an integrated supply chain when top management is personally involved in the technology implementation process. © 2011, IGI Global."

Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on the knowledge-based view, a theoretical framework is developed consisting of six KM processes: knowledge creation, knowledge capture, knowledge organization, knowledge storage, knowledge dissemination, and knowledge application, and the performance of supply chain is evaluated in terms of four Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) process elements: Plan, Source, Make, and Delivery. Structural equation modeling is employed using a sample of 78 Iranian manufacturers in mechanical and engineering industry. Findings - Empirical results show that KM processes have a significant impact on supply chain performance which is positively moderated by IT/IS support and supply chain integration. While the moderating effect of IT/IS support is found to be considerably stronger, the relationship between KM processes and supply chain performance is not significantly different in lean and agile supply chains. Research limitations/implications - Since the sample for this study is small and drawn only from manufacturing companies in mechanical and engineering industry, it would be important to conduct further empirical studies with larger samples from a wider range of industries to improve and strengthen our analyses and provide more conclusive and generalizable results. Originality/value - Through empirical study, a better understanding of the impact of KM processes on supply chain performance and the moderating role of IT/IS support and supply chain integration can be gained."

The frame of reference intends to foster the coordination in buyer-supplier relations and eliminates existing inefficiencies in the execution of discrete SCF-instruments, such as reverse factoring and dynamic discounting. Moreover, we introduce value drivers for blockchain technology (BCT) to elaborate unique characteristics for its application in the field of SCF. While BCT is considered as one of the most disruptive enablers in financial technology (FinTech), it received only little attention within the emerging field of SCF. Therefore, the results contribute to future developments of appropriate SCF-solutions based on the newest technology innovations. 1. Introduction The relevance of working capital optimization and cost of capital reduction is highlighted by an increasing adoption of supply chain finance (SCF) instruments within industries. From a single firm perspective, it is important to optimize the financial flow by applying low-cost financing solutions (Klapper, 2006). From a broader supply chain perspective, SCF has further the ability to create a win-win situation for both, buyers and suppliers by improving liquidity and capital allocation across the value chain (Popa, 2013). Instruments as reverse factoring or dynamic discounting enable companies to optimize working capital and to smoothen financial risk. Although potential advantages of SCF solutions are already known in theory, the execution of these instruments still show inefficiencies in practice. Whereas SCF offers a wide range of techniques, blockchain technology (BCT) inheres a disruptive potential for the development, deployment, and usage of convenient business applications as well in the area of SCF. The digitization of physical supply chains received a lot of attention in recent years, but the flow of goods, information and finance are often considered as isolated streams across different functions and parties. Thus, the initiation of business processes is dependent on sequential input and manual confirmation (Zhang and Dhaliwal, 2009). Additionally, transactions involve a vast number of agents and intermediaries. High costs and complexity for large IT-systems, security flaws as well as time consuming processing are just some of the disadvantages of the operations today (Fellenz et al., 2009). According to that, weak contract institution, tax, legal systems, and regulations exacerbate effective interaction and standard procedures between supply chain partners (Klapper, 2006). Moreover, inconsistent governance structures complicate the collection of"

The results from a sample of 84 firsttier suppliers of the automotive industry showed that the impact of internal IT on the implementation of Lean Production is greater, and the same for external IT on the electronic integration of the supply chain. Moreover, it showed how the relationship between internal IT and the implementation of Lean Production is stronger when it is controlled by the presence of external IT.

Based on a general supply-chain model with acceptance sampling tests under uncertain product quality, we show that, depending on the sampling technology, the decentralized supply-chain structure may lead to a distortion in product quality. We also explore the effects of different pricing and regulatory options of vertical control on product quality and the distribution of the total supply-chain profit. In addition, we use an exploratory case study of the 2008 adulterated milk incident in China to investigate practical issues in ensuring product quality/safety in food supply chain management. Our analytical results and two comparative cases show that, instead of the common ""poor quality"" misperception of food products from global emerging markets, it is actually the poor vertical control strategy for managing the food supply chain quality and risk that caused the adulterated milk incident.

Background: Supply chain sustainability is a central concern of most organizations. The main objective of sustainable supply chains is to create and maintain long term economic, social, and environmental value for all stakeholders involved in delivering products and services to markets. As sustainability constitutes one of the critical drivers of innovation, the recent emergence of blockchain technology typifies the disruptive impact of digital innovation on supply chain sustainability. Blockchain is a foundational technology that poses a shift in the development of supply chain sustainability. Methods: Despite the increasing importance of blockchain in improving supply chain efficiencies and bringing societal changes, research investigating its potentialities from the lens of sustainability is scarce. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to fill this knowledge gap and synthesize the literature from leading journals on the topic of blockchain and its relation to supply chain sustainability. Papers were collected from different scientific databases and carefully analyzed. The possibilities of blockchains are identified and classified according to the triple bottom line framework, namely the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Results and conclusions: The majority of studies focused on the economic implications of blockchains on supply chains. The sustainable economic aspects of the technology identified in the reviewed literature are mostly the transformational potentials of blockchains and their capabilities to drive new disintermediated business models, higher operational efficiencies, cost advantages, and additional sources of value creation. The social empowerment of supply chains is found through the ability of blockchain to create trustful relationships among supply chain partners, increase food safety, support humanitarian logistics, and promote social equity. Moreover, firms attempting to move forward in their environmental policies and strategies can use blockchain to extend their efforts to improve their environmental practices across the supply chain, reduce the strain on energy and natural resources, and offer environmentally friendly products."

Three elements of supply chain integration (company integration with suppliers, cross functional integration within a company and company integration with customers) and three elements of supply chain flexibility (adaptability, alignment and agility) were subjected to analysis. The results indicate that supply chain integration and supply chain flexibility exhibit significant correlation with firm performance. Supply chain integration and supply chain flexibility have high correlation with ‘financial performance’ followed by ‘logistic performance’ and then ‘operational performance’. Also, the results demonstrate that four supply chain integration surrogates; ‘production data integration’, ‘going after customers for feedback’, ‘periodic connection with customers’ and ‘real time search of inventory’ and two supply chain flexibility proxies specifically ‘technology’ and ‘supply network strategies’ are crucial as they exhibit the most noteworthy influence on firm performance. Results of this study offer remarkable demonstrations of the effects of integration and flexibility in enhancing performance of businesses and greater attention must be paid to those proxies of supply chain integration and flexibility that exhibited the most significant impact on firm’s performance."

In this context, companies are increasingly held accountable for social and ecological issues that lie within the sphere of action of their suppliers and sub-suppliers. They are thus faced with the challenge of meeting these demands for transparency, traceability, and compliance with standards in their Supply Chains (SCs). Based on the theoretical framework of Sustainable Supply Chain Transparency (SSCT) in Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM), this conceptual article aims at initiating the discussion on digitalization in SSCM. Therefore, a heuristical research framework, based on relevant fields in the management of sustainability oriented transparency (governance, cooperation and partner selection, traceability/tracking, and strategic and operational risk assessment) is developed. In relation to these fields, consequently, data-driven digital approaches are identified to which potentials for SSCT and control can be attributed. This initial analysis of existing digital approaches already shows that the market is developing dynamically, but is driven more by individual initiatives. In many cases, the approaches used so far are still in the trial phase or offer only limited solutions. Therefore, this paper contributes by giving an overview of the current application of the digitalization approaches in SSCM pinning our discussion on SSCT dimensions."

The SMEs in Indian food sector are facing different challenges, such as financial issues, lack of technical skills and investment in the business etc. In this sense, several key factors can help food SMEs in reducing wastage of farm products and lowering energy consumption for sustainable growth. Thus, this paper tries to identify and analyse key factors for Information Communication Technology (ICT) applications for a sustainable growth of SMEs in Indian food sector. Grey based Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory technique was applied for analysis of factors. From findings, ‘Government initiatives and policies’, ‘Public-private partnership’, and ‘Encouragement to ICT service provider’ are topmost influential cause group factors. While, ‘ICT integrated effective food supply chain’, ‘Coordination between different departments’, and ‘Collaboration and strategic alliances across supply chain’ are highest influenced factors. Results suggests that ‘Government policies and initiatives’ are at the core of the efforts to upgrade food supply chain. As, Indian government is the largest customer of SMEs and controls various policy-making aspects in food sector. Therefore, government has to take steps to encourage private and foreign investments as well as promote IT service providers and business environment related economic policies to improve competitiveness of Indian food sector. This work would help managers to develop efficient ICT applications for an effective sustainable growth of SMEs in their respective food supply chains."

Access to these essential medicines is a major need in order to achieve ‘Good Health to All’. Traditionally, India has been a rural, agrarian economy where the majority of the population still live in villages. The main factors which affect the provision of good healthcare among the rural population are affordability, unavailability and average quality of drugs and other medical supplies. The availability and quality of medicines are substandard when compared to the urban population standards.To promote proper utilization of medicines, there is a need for availability and affordability of quality medicines in the presence of ‘rational drug usage’ ideology among the medical professionals and health workers. They play a vital role in imparting the knowledge of drug information to the patient community which in the long run can help in achieving the goal of health to all.

Methods Working with the Mozambique Ministry of Health, our team implemented a new process that integrated HERMES computational simulation modeling and on-the-ground implementers to evaluate and improve the Mozambique vaccine supply chain using a system-re-design that integrated new supply chain structures, information technology, equipment, personnel, and policies. Results The alternative system design raised vaccine availability (from 66% to 93% in Gaza; from 76% to 84% in Cabo Delgado) and reduced the logistics cost per dose administered (from $0.53 to $0.32 in Gaza; from $0.38 to $0.24 in Cabo Delgado) as compared to the multi-tiered system under the current EPI. The alternative system also produced higher availability at lower costs after new vaccine introductions. Since reviewing scenarios modeling deliveries every two months in the north of Gaza, the provincial directorate has decided to pilot this approach diverging from decades of policies dictating monthly deliveries. Discussion Re-design improved not only supply chain efficacy but also efficiency, important since resources to deliver vaccines are limited. The Mozambique experience and process can serve as a model for other countries during the Decade of Vaccines. For the Decade of Vaccines, getting vaccines at affordable prices to the market is not enough. Vaccines must reach the population to be successful."

Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative analysis are undertaken via case studies drawn from food companies using semi-structured interviews. Findings: Blockchain is demonstrated as an enabler of visibility in supply chains. Applications at scale are most likely for products where the end consumer is prepared to pay the premium currently required to fund the technology, e.g. baby food. Challenges remain in four areas: trust of the technology, human error and fraud at the boundaries, governance, consumer data access and willingness to pay. Research limitations/implications: The paper shows that blockchain can be utilised as part of a system generating visibility and trust in supply chains. Research directs academic attention to issues that remain to be addressed.

It is found that both information sharing and information quality are influenced positively by trust in supply chain partners and shared vision between supply chain partners, but negatively by supplier uncertainty. Top management has a positive impact on information sharing but has no impact on information quality. The results also show that information sharing and information quality are not impacted by customer uncertainty, technology uncertainty, commitment of supply chain partners, and IT enablers. Moreover, a discriminant analysis reveals that supplier uncertainty, shared vision between supply chain partners and commitment of supply chain partners are the three most important factors in discriminating between the organizations with high levels of information sharing and information quality and those with low levels of information sharing and information quality. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Here, the performance is categorized as supply chain performance and organizational performance that comprises of financial performance and marketing performance. Contingent resource-based view (RBV) theory was used to develop a theoretical framework in which supply base complexity (SBC) acts as a moderating variable on the relationship between cloud ERP and the performance.

Product and process complexity and capacity issues are the main challenge for the Pharmaceutical Industry Supply chain. Manufacturing Technology should be acknowledged as a R&D step and as a very important matter during University degree in Pharmacy and related disciplines, promoting collaboration between Academia and Industry, measured during HTA step and rewarded in terms of price and reimbursement. The above elements are not yet properly recognised, and manufacturing technology is taken in to consideration only when a shortage is in place. In a previous work, Panzitta et al. proposed to perform a full technology assessment at the Health Technological Assessment stage, evaluating three main technical aspects of a medicine: manufacturing process, physicochemical properties, and formulation characteristics. In this paper, we develop the concept of manufacturing appraisal, providing a technical overview of upcoming challenges, a risk based approach and an economic picture of shortage costs. We develop also an overall quality concept, not limited to GMP factors but broaden to all elements leading to a robust supply and promoting technical innovation."

Hence, it has the potential to change the humanitarian context fundamentally, but there is still relatively little-published research aimed at improving the understanding of the different barriers of the blockchain adoption in humanitarian supply chain. The goal of this research is to present a comprehensive review of blockchain adoption barriers in the context of humanitarian supply chain management. An integrated approach using Fuzzy Delphi and Best-Worst method (BWM) has been used for analyzing the barriers. Based on the literature, 14 barriers of the blockchain adoption in humanitarian supply chain were identified. According to the Fuzzy Delphi result, 9 barriers were accepted. After that, the BWM calculated the importance of each barrier. The findings showed that regulatory uncertainty, lack of knowledge/employee training and high sustainability costs are the important barriers. This research provides useful guidelines for policy makers so that they can benefit from the results to optimize their solutions."

Incorporating sensors into packaging is promising, but it is challenging to achieve the required sampling volume while using food-safe sensor materials. Here, by leveraging water-based processing of silk fibroin, a platform for the detection of pathogenic bacteria in food is realized using a porous silk microneedle array; the microneedle array samples fluid from the interior of the food by capillary action, presenting the fluid to polydiacetylene-based bioinks printed on the backside of the array. Through the colorimetric response of bioink patterns, Escherichia coli contamination in fish fillets is identified within 16 h of needle injection. This response is distinct from spoilage measured via the increase in sample pH. It is also shown that the microneedles can pierce commercial food packaging, and subsequently sample fluid and present it to the sensor, enabling the adaptation of the technology downstream in food supply chains such as in stores or at home. This study highlights that regenerated structural biopolymers can serve as safe materials for food contact and sensing with robust mechanical properties and tailored chemistry."

Critical to the growth of Industry 4.0 is the coordination among supply chain entities, in particular when Industry 4.0 is proposed to improve sustainability efforts. Studies in green supply chain literature have often considered the market expansion effects of greening efforts. However, a number of other factors influence greening efforts, a critical one being the price premium effect driven by the brand building strategy of firms. A principal issue then arises as to which strategy should firms adopt and when does each greening effect benefit firms and supply chains more. We generate several insights into this important issue by developing models considering dyadic settings, competition, and cost-sharing contract. We examine strategic decisions in these channel structures and compare and contrast our results with the market expansion based models. We identify a number of counter-intuitive results, for example, a dyadic channel with high price-sensitive consumers would benefit more from the price premium effect and cost-sharing (when it focusses on building brand) than market expansion. We also conduct intra-channel and inter-channel comparison of outcomes to understand the effect of competition. Among other results, we find that in the presence of a dominant retailer and competing manufacturers, the retailer shares more greening cost with the manufacturer than the corresponding decentralized channel."

We use organizational information processing theory (OIPT) to develop hypotheses that identify the comprehensiveness of an organization's supply chain planning capabilities as an important mediator in the relationship between its supply chain integration activities and its operational performance. Further, our interpretation of OIPT suggests that an organization's usage of technology-enabled supply chain management systems (SCMS) moderates these effects. Using survey data from 445 global firms, we estimate the corresponding moderated-mediation structural model. The results indicate that usage of SCMS enables organizations to better utilize the information they gain from external integration efforts (relationships with customers and suppliers), thus improving the comprehensiveness of their supply chain planning capabilities. In contrast, the use of SCMS appears to be a partial substitute for internal integration as a driver of planning comprehensiveness. Most importantly, the results suggest that planning comprehensiveness is a significant generative means by which integration and technology investments produce superior operational performance. These findings provide a richer and more theoretically grounded explanation of relationships between supply chain integration, supply chain planning, and operational performance."

We consider three investment scenarios, i.e., the investment is made by the manufacturer, both the retailers, or only one retailer. By investigating these scenarios, we find that the manufacturer prefers to have both the retailers make the investment. However, the retailers may prefer not to let their supply chain partner, i.e., the manufacturer, make the investment. In addition, because of the spillover effect from the competitor's investment, a free rider can improve its profit, though the improvement is insignificant. Moreover, we find that it is possible to simultaneously achieve economic and environmental optimality in the scenario in which both the retailers make the investment, whereby all supply chain members’ profits and the emission reduction are higher than those in other scenarios. Furthermore, analyzing the effects of the investment on consumers, we find that in most cases, the more eco-friendly the product is, the higher retail price the consumers must pay."

Business-to-business e-commerce is a new way of doing business. It tends to follow a ""reverse product cycle"" where process efficiency gains come first, followed by quality improvements to existing products and services, and finally the creation of new services and products appear (OECD). The e-commerce marketplace is one where strategy, expectations about others actions, and trust determine demand. For purposes of this paper, the buyers-users in this e-commerce market are retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers who buy and sell products to and from each other. The seller is a service provider who can produce a reliable electronic logistics network that will improve communications and will speed up product flow. Using information technology in this way tends to build vertical alliances. It differs from a market discovery e-commerce (shopping sites) in that it involves an intimate relationship among market agents that lasts for more than one transaction and frequently covers several products, over multiple time periods."

Keywords: supply chain, supply chain management, customer relation management, information technology 1. Introduction According to Christopher (1998) today not the size of products and economic scale, but the supply chain management is necessarily a powerful solution to achieve a cost advantage. He believes that the supply chain is a network from upstream and downstream organizations. These organizations are involved in different processes and activities that produce value in the form of products and services on their final customers. (Christopher,1998) Moreover, we can say that today all organizations are exposed to the developments in information technology. And the application of information technology and communication are obvious in all areas of the supply chain including the communication with suppliers and production and customer relation. So the use of information technology affects on the improvement of the supply chain management. (Aghajani, 2008) This paper attempts to review the literature and previous studies, and investigates the role of information and customer relation management in the supply chain. It finally presents the importance of information technology in customer relation management and supply chain. 2.

Access to these essential medicines is a major need in order to achieve ‘Good Health to All’. Traditionally, India has been a rural, agrarian economy where the majority of the population still live in villages. The main factors which affect the provision of good healthcare among the rural population are affordability, unavailability and average quality of drugs and other medical supplies. The availability and quality of medicines are substandard when compared to the urban population standards. To promote proper utilization of medicines, there is a need for availability and affordability of quality medicines in the presence of ‘rational drug usage’ ideology among the medical professionals and health workers. They play a vital role in imparting the knowledge of drug information to the patient community which in the long run can help in achieving the goal of health to all. This paper showcases the need and emergence of a pharmaceutical supply chain mechanism in the healthcare industry and how it can prove to be the backbone of the present public healthcare system by enhancing it with information communication technology (ICT) implementation.

We have endeavored to make sufficiently objective and appropriate conclusions that guide how the model can be used in other sectors or by other decision makers. This review has several aims. First, we aim to understand the technical application of TBL optimization and to associate it with the use of mathematical and statistical analysis. Second, we present a fuzzy integrated linguistic operator weighted average application to better understand TBL and to strengthen the argument for its use.

One approach is to examine costs along the supply chain using technology to reduce identified costs. The purpose of this study was to identify key attributes that affect a school nutrition program's willingness to adopt technology for supply chain management (SCM). A survey design was used to gather data from the 500 school districts with the highest enrollment in the United States. An online questionnaire with a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree , 5 = strongly agree ) gathered data from school nutrition program professionals about their supply chain and information orientations and their willingness to engage in technology-enabled SCM initiatives. The response rate was 31.8%. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze demographic traits of the respondents and their school district. Typical respondents were females, 51-60 years old, with an advanced college degree and 20 or more years of foodservice experience. On average the respondent's school nutrition program was operated by the school district (92.4%), employed fewer than 500 workers (77.3%), was financially solvent (71.5%), and did not centralize food purchasing (60.2%), production (84.7%), or delivery functions (60.2%). Respondents extensively utilized software within their departments and to exchange information with other departments in the school district, with other members of their supply chain, and also with their customers. Factor analysis identified three factors of supply chain orientation: Trust ( M = 4.40), Top Management Support (M = 2.73), and Commitment (M = 3.92). Information Management Practices ( M = 4.17) was identified for information orientation, and the average rating for Overall Information Management was 4.30. In general, respondents were willing to adopt technology for SCM initiatives (M = 3.98). Multiple regression analysis determined that supply chain orientation but not information orientation predicted a willingness to adopt technology for SCM. School nutrition personnel are well-advised to gain top management support prior to engaging in projects to implement technology for SCM initiatives and to select supply chain partners to whom they are fully committed and trust. Future research is needed to further explore SCM technology initiatives already underway in school districts. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

Model integration is a precondition for efficient development and utilization of these models. This paper discusses use of modern information technology (IT) techniques and methods for integration of supply chain decision-making models. The overall approach to using IT at various stages of model development is presented. Data and process modeling techniques are used to developed semi-formalized representation of integrated models. These models support integration of decision-making components with other parts of supply chain information system. Process modeling is also used to describe interrelationships among multiple decision-making models. This representation is used as the basis for implementation of integrated models. The service-oriented architecture is proposed as an implementation platform. The presented discussion serves as the basis for further developments in developing integrated supply chain decision-making models.

This study defines the distribution of total methane and CO2 emissions from the natural gas supply chain, identifying the contribution from each stage and quantifying the effect of key parameters on emissions. The study uses recent high-resolution emissions measurements with estimates of parameter distributions to build a probabilistic emissions model for a variety of technological supply chain scenarios. The distribution of emissions resembles a log-log-logistic distribution for most supply chain scenarios, indicating an extremely heavy tailed skew: median estimates which represent typical facilities are modest at 18–24 g CO2 eq./MJ HHV, but mean estimates which account for the heavy tail are 22–107 g CO2 eq./MJ HHV. To place these values into context, emissions associated with natural gas combustion (e.g. for heat) are approximately 55 g CO2/MJ HHV. Thus, some supply chain scenarios are major contributors to total greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas. For methane-only emissions, median estimates are 0.8–2.2% of total methane production, with mean emissions of 1.6–5.5%. The heavy tail distribution is the signature of the disproportionately large emitting equipment known as super-emitters, which appear at all stages of the supply chain. The study analyses the impact of different technological options and identifies a set of best technological option (BTO) scenarios. This suggests that emissions-minimising technology can reduce supply chain emissions significantly, with this study estimating median emissions of 0.9% of production. However, even with the emissions-minimising technologies, evidence suggests that the influence of the super-emitters remains. Therefore, emissions-minimising technology is only part of the solution: reducing the impact of super emitters requires more effective detection and rectification, as well as pre-emptive maintenance processes."

Many articles have been published with regards Industry 4.0; however, there is no research that clearly conceptualizes Industry 4.0 in the context of supply chain. This paper aims to propose the term “Supply Chain 4.0” together with a novel conceptual framework that captures the essence of Industry 4.0 within the supply chain context. As Industry 4.0 is inherently a revolution, and as revolutions are evolutionary, this research also aims to capture the evolution of Supply Chain 4.0 from maturity levels perspective to facilitate the formulation and development of Supply Chain 4.0 strategy. Design/methodology/approach: Following a deductive research approach and a qualitative strategy, a systematic literature review (SLR) was adopted as the research method seeking to understand the relationships among supply chain, Industry 4.0 and maturity levels research. The three phases of the SLR process utilized are: planning, conducting and reporting. A concept-oriented technique was applied to the outputs of the SLR to obtain the key constructs that would facilitate the development of the conceptual Supply Chain 4.0 framework. Findings: The SLR showed that there is limited research linking Industry 4.0 to supply chain. Nevertheless, it was possible to extract a set of thematic categories from the analysis of the articles which are referred to as constructs as they form the core of the conceptual Supply Chain 4.0 framework. These constructs are managerial and capability supporters, technology levers, processes performance requirements and strategic outcomes. Each of these constructs consists of a number of elements which are referred to as “dimensions” in this research and a total of 21 dimensions were identified during the SLR. The SLR also demonstrated that maturity propositions for Industry 4.0 are still embrionary and entirely missing in the context of supply chain. Hence, this research develops and proposes a maturity levels framework that is underpinned by the core constructs of Supply Chain 4.0 and the corresponding dimensions. As these proposed frameworks are conceptual, this research also identifies and proposes several research directions to help fortify the Supply Chain 4.0 concept. Research limitations/implications: This research argues that the frameworks are robust because the constructs and dimensions are grounded in the literature, thus demonstrating both theoretical and practical relevance and value. As Supply Chain 4.0 research is still in infancy, there is a range of open research questions suggested based on the frameworks that could serve as guides for researchers to further develop the Supply Chain 4.0 concept. Also, practitioners can use this framework to develop better understanding of Supply Chain 4.0 and be able to evaluate the maturity of their organizations. As the proposed frameworks are conceptual, they require further empirical research to validate them and obtain new insights. Originality/value: The SLR demonstrated a clear gap in literature with regards to Industry 4.0 in the context of supply chain, and also in the context of Industry 4.0 maturity levels for supply chain. This research is unique as it formulates and introduces novel frameworks that close these gaps in literature. The value of this research lies in the fact that it makes significant contribution in terms of understanding of Supply Chain 4.0 with a clear set of constructs and dimensions that form Supply Chain 4.0, which provides the foundation for further work in this area."

By considering both fixed cost and tag cost of RFID implementation, we study the agents' incentives to adopt RFID in both uncoordinated and coordinated cases. We focus on analyzing the impact of risk attitudes on the agents' incentives and on the supply chain coordination. The central semi-deviation is adopted to measure the retailer's risk attitude. In the uncoordinated case, we find that, in order to induce the retailer to adopt RFID, the manufacturer must assume more fixed cost if the retailer is more risk-averse. In the coordinated case, we first show that the standard revenue sharing contract does not always coordinate the channel. If the channel is coordinated, we observe that the agents' incentives will be perfectly aligned and independent of the risk attitudes, if the revenue sharing ratio equals the fixed cost sharing ratio. Then we propose a risk-sharing contract that offers the risk protection to the retailer, to achieve the channel coordination. An interesting finding is that the manufacturer's incentive will not decrease with the tag cost, if she takes much risk from the retailer. The corresponding impacts of RFID adoption on the two contracts are also analyzed in this paper. Finally, a case study in a tobacco industry is presented to show the real RFID cost in practice. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

The results showed that an optimal carbon emission reduction rate that made the players' profits achieve a Pareto improvement was existed. The optimal emission reduction rate was positively correlated with carbon tax and negatively correlated with per unit carbon emission. The revenue-sharing contract could effectively coordinate the supply chain with/without carbon emission reduction technology. In addition, the revenue-sharing parameters' scope and interval bounds were both in negative correlation to carbon tax and unit carbon emission. Moreover, the relationship between revenue-sharing parameters and carbon reduction rate was the same as the relationship between carbon reduction rate and incremental profits."

The purpose of this paper is to examine the perception of the academic community of the impact of the IoT adoption in organizational supply chains with a view to verify potential key benefits and challenges existent in the literature. The research presents the impact on an organization along with the impact across its entire supply chain. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected through the use of an online survey and 87 participants completed the survey. Participants were mainly from the academic community and were university scholars based in different countries located in six continents. Participants were authors, or co-authors, of academic papers published in the Decision Science Institute 2015 and 2016 annual conference proceedings, the 21st International Symposium of Sustainable Transport and Supply Chain Innovations, the Supply Chain Management: An International Journal 2016 issues, and the Operations and Supply Chain Management: An International Journal 2016 issues. Findings - The authors were able to confirm the significance of some of the examined potential benefits to individual organizations and their entire supply chains. However, the study identified other potential benefits that were not seen as a direct impact of IoT adoption. Most of the examined potential benefits were found to contribute to a number of critical success factors for implementing successful SCM. The authors were also able to confirm that some of the examined potential challenges were still perceived as key hinders to IoT adoption but examined potential challenges were not seen as hurdles to IoT adoption.

The concept recognizes effective and efficient economic functioning at multiple scales-governments and individuals, globally and locally; for businesses, large and small. CE represents a systemic shift that builds long-term resilience at multiple levels (macro, meso and micro); generating new business and economic opportunities while providing environmental and societal benefits. Blockchain, an emergent and critical technology, is introduced to the circular economy environment as a potential enabler for many circular economic principles. Blockchain technology supported information systems can improve circular economy performance at multiple levels. Product deletion, a neglected but critical effort in product management and product portfolio management, is utilized as an illustrative business scenario as to blockchain's application in a circular economy research context. Product deletion, unlike product proliferation, has received minimal attention from both academics and practitioners. Product deletion decisions need to be evaluated and analyzed in the circular economy context. CE helps address risk aversion issues in product deletions such as inventory, waste and information management. This paper is the first to conceptualize the relationships amongst blockchain technology, product deletion and the circular economy. Many nuances of relationships are introduced in this study. Future evaluation and critical reflections are also presented with a need for a rigorous and robust research agenda to evaluate the multiple and complex relationships and interplay amongst technology, policy, commerce and the natural environment."

Organizations have responded to these challenges by implementing collaborative supply chain management (SCM) which allows their organizations to gain competitive advantages. E-collaboration implementation is one of the key technologies to facilitate the success of SCM, which allows the integration of business processes and the sharing of information among supply chain members. E-collaboration has been implemented with considerable success in the supply chain by organizations such as Infineon and Wal-Mart. However, these large organizations have more financial and technical resources compared to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Little research on the implementation of e-collaboration has focused on the perspective of SMEs.

Design/methodology/approach: Strategic alternatives are investigated by using option pricing tools to examine the impact of various characteristics of green technology development and supply chain relations on the timing of the decision. Findings: The theoretical and empirical results show that a polluting firm should not consider the option of relocating to offshore countries if uncertainty has been anticipated. It is suggested that, by facing green technology development uncertainty, a firm should be refrained from relocating production abroad if technology develops and offshore cost advantage disappears soon. On the other hand, a pre-emptive migration strategy is preferable when the green technology is anticipated to be delayed. Practical implications: A polluting firm in a supply chain faces challenges of uncertainty depending on whether it decides to produce domestically or to relocate internationally. The analysis conveys a concept that polluting firms can be more profitable by promoting clean production technology, instead of relocating to offshore or so called pollution havens.

As a result, they have improved their ability to coordinate and synchronize shared business processes by using more complete, accurate, and timely information. These electronic linkages are based on open-standard interorganizational information systems (OSIOS), which are fundamentally different from traditional electronic data interchanges. OSIOS capture not only the technical specifications for data interchange but also the sequential steps for the execution of shared business processes. Because OSIOS are still at an early diffusion stage, it remains unclear why firms would assimilate such an innovation and whether assimilation provides firms any benefits. In this research, we develop a framework grounded on the economics of standards, institutional theory, and strategic interorganizational information systems literatures to investigate the drivers and outcomes of OSIOS assimilation in a focused context. In order to test our hypotheses based on this framework, we used data from a high-technology supply chain and employed econometrics techniques. We found that both competition asymmetry across supply chain echelons and OSIOS assimilation within supply chain echelons predict individual firms' OSIOS assimilation. The results also suggest that firms' supply chain dominance is both a driver and an outcome of OSIOS assimilation, highlighting a mutually reinforcing process. In addition, our study reveals boundary conditions of the hypothesized relationships. The use of multiple theoretical perspectives, a unique dataset, and innovative statistical techniques to investigate OSIOS assimilation in high-technology supply chains contributes to the body of knowledge in both the supply chain management and management of information systems disciplines."

It proposes different mechanisms to explain how intra- and inter-organizational ICT interact with supply chain integration, and contribute to supply chain performance. The main research question is: What are the distinctive roles of inter-organizational ICT and intra-organizational ICT in improving supply chain performance? Design/methodology/approach – The paper builds on original survey data of 320 Chinese manufacturing firms gathered in China. Findings – The paper shows that inter-organizational ICT has a positive direct relationship with supply chain performance and this relationship is mediated by supply chain integration. Intra-organizational ICT has no direct relationship with supply chain performance. However, intra-organizational ICT moderates the effect of the supply chain integration on supply chain performance. Research limitations/implications – The paper argues that more research into the specific roles and interaction of ICT with business processes is needed in order to better understand its role in improving supply chain performance. Practical implications – For managers the findings show that inter- and intra-organizational ICT play a different role in the improvement of supply chain performance: the first leading to more supply chain integration, which in turn improves performance, while the second needs additional investment in integrative practices to help improve supply chain performance. Originality/value – This paper adds to the debate on the role of ICT in improving supply chain performance and shows that a detailed investigation into underlying mechanisms, and the interaction of ICT with other business processes is valuable."

Methods: The BRUINchain system requirements include scanning the drug package for a correctly formatted 2D barcode, flagging expired product, verifying the product with the manufacturer, and quarantining suspect and illegitimate products at the last mile: pharmacist to patient, the most complex area of the drug supply chain. The authors demonstrate a successful implementation where product-tracing notifications are sent automatically to key stakeholders, resulting in enhanced timeliness and reduction in paperwork burden. At the core of this effort was a blockchain-based solution to track and trace changes in custody of drug. As an immutable, time-stamped, near-real-time (50-millisecond latency), auditable record of transactions, BRUINchain makes it possible for supply chain communities to arrive at a single version of the truth. BRUINchain was tested with real data on real caregivers administering life-saving medications to real patients at one of the busiest pharmacies in the United States. Results: In addition to communicating with the manufacturer directly for verification, BRUINchain also initiated suspect product notifications. During the study, a 100% success rate was observed across scanning, expiration detection, and counterfeit detection; and paperwork reduction from approximately 1 hour to less than a minute. The authors demonstrate a successful implementation where product-tracing notifications are sent automatically to key stakeholders, resulting in enhanced timeliness and reduction in paperwork burden.

BRUINchain was tested with real data on real caregivers administering life-saving medications to real patients at one of the busiest pharmacies in the United States.   Conclusions: By automatically interrogating the manufacturer’s relational database with our blockchain-based system, our results indicate a projected DSCSA compliance cost of 17 cents per unit, and potentially much more depending on regulatory interpretation and speed of verification. We project that this cost could be reduced with manufacturers’ adoption of a highly performant, fully automated end-to-end system based on digital ledger technology (DLT). In an examination of the interoperability of such a system, we elaborate on its capacity to enable verification in real time without a human in the loop, the key feature driving lower compliance cost. With 4.2 billion prescriptions being dispensed each year in the United States, DLT would not only reduce the projected per-unit cost to 13 cents per unit (saving $183 million in annual labor costs), but also serve as a major bulwark against bad or fraudulent transactions, reduce the need for safety stock, and enhance the detection and removal of potentially dangerous drugs from the drug supply chain to protect U.S. consumers."

However, local decisions can lead to suboptimal outcomes at the global level, as with the bullwhip effect and vicious cycles, if cooperation between supply chain members gives way to competition. Forecasting systems and other forms of information technology promise to alleviate the bullwhip effect and vicious cycles but may actually exacerbate these problems if used inappropriately. Inappropriate trust in the forecasting technology can lead to erroneous decisions, and supply chain members may misinterpret these technology- induced errors as the intent of other supply chain members to compete. This paper reviews literature regarding trust in technology and presents a framework for information sharing that can help to promote appropriate trust in supply chain technology and in other supply chain members. Explicitly considering trust in technology may lead to improved supply chain performance and may protect against loss of trust between supply chain members. Overall, this paper identifies human interaction with forecasting systems and other types of technology as an important contributor to cooperation and performance in supply chains."

Drawing on innovation diffusion theory and technology-organization-environment framework, we developed a conceptual model for RFID adoption in supply chains. Survey data were collected worldwide and included different players in supply chains, such as manufacturers, transporters, wholesalers, and retailers. Our analysis based on logistic regression demonstrated that technology complexity, technology maturity, top management support, trading partner power, and trading partner readiness were significant predictors for RFID adoption in supply chain activities. This study is the first empirical study to test and validate technology maturity as an important factor for technology adoption.

The findings of this study show that cloud-based information sharing improves visibility in healthcare supply chains. As supply chain visibility increases, a hospital's responsiveness improves. Hospitals are now in a better position to accommodate fluctuations in patient demand and supply lead times. As a consequence, hospital supply chains will experience reductions in inventory costs, supply costs, and supply shortages."

Even though such partnerships bring the venture many benefits, they also come with significant challenges, notably the need to seamlessly combine a “technology push” philosophy with a “market pull” one. Utilizing a data set of over both upstream and downstream alliance partnerships spanning 603 technology ventures in the biotech industry, interesting results were found with regard to the impact of these two alliance partnerships on the venture's invention success and commercialization success. Upstream partnerships demonstrate a positive impact on invention success but no significant impact on commercialization success. However, with the moderating role of downstream partnerships, the results change: the joint effect of these two types of alliance partnerships is positive for both invention and commercialization success. The study findings have important implications with regard to the role and impact of alliance partnerships at the intersection of small business, entrepreneurship and technology innovation, and for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers."

Food issues are addressed in the International Labour Organization’s (ILO’s) Food and Catering (Ships’ Crews) Convention 1946 (No. 68), amended 2006. Moreover, the enforcement of the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) Regulations and Code appears to have ensured that seafarers have hygienic conditions and that good quality food and drinking water are provided. The MLC aims to meet all current standards of international maritime labour conventions and recommendations, and comply with the fundamental principles found in other international labour conventions. Yet despite these efforts, food issues require greater attention, as maintaining the food supply chain is a dynamic and difficult task. To identify strategies for improving the procurement of food for ships, this paper illustrates how to facilitate the food supply for shipping lines and further evaluate the associated supply chain. Advanced technology, comprehensive procurement procedures, qualified personnel, extensive outbound logistics (i.e., distribution) networks and sound training programmes on food quality and safety are critical elements in the food supply chain, and will enhance the quality of food for seafarers."

To better promote supply chain emission reduction, this paper analyzes the carbon emission transfer and emission reduction problem among enterprises within the supply chain, integrating the influence of government emission reduction policies and the low carbon market. Considering the lag time of emission reduction technologies and the low-carbon preferences of consumers, a Stackelberg differential game model (dominated by manufacturers) is constructed under both centralized and decentralized decisions. The results suggest that the lag time of emission reduction technology and the low carbon preference of consumers positively affect the carbon emission transfer level of manufacturers, while not affecting suppliers’ undertaking levels. Only when the lag time of emission reduction technology remains within a specific range, will an increase in consumers’ low-carbon preferences exert a positive impact on supply chain profits. Notably, under decentralized decision-making, when the emission reduction technology lag time and consumers’ low carbon preference remain within a specific range, the carbon emission transfer behavior exerts a positive promoting effect on the emission reduction of the supply chain. This applies when the profit of the supply chain increases and the carbon emission reduction per unit of product decreases. This result provides a new idea for the government to control irrational carbon emission transfer behavior of enterprises. Moreover, considering the lag time of emission reduction technology is also conducive to increasing the acceptability of government carbon quota."

Historically, the uneven distribution of phosphate rock has been regarded as the major reason for this unbalanced use. However, the international trade of commodities may also play an important role in the unbalanced use of phosphorus fertilizers. By tracing the trade flows of commodities, we found that nearly 5.2 Tg of phosphorus fertilizer was embodied in traded commodities, which were mainly exported from large emerging countries (with low phosphorus use efficiencies) to developed countries (e.g., the US, Western Europe and Japan, commonly with high phosphorus use efficiencies). Furthermore, among the 5.2 Tg of phosphorus fertilizer embodied in traded commodities, 2.5 Tg was embodied in the trade of commodities from industry, construction, and services. Our results indicate that this trade pattern could create substantial mutual benefits if improvements are made to the phosphorus supply chain. With technology transfer and financial support from developed countries, large emerging countries could use phosphorus fertilizers more efficiently, thereby reducing the risk of eutrophication and lowering the cost of agricultural production. The phosphorus fertilizers saved by large emerging countries could be partially used to enhance food production in Sub-Saharan African countries. This optimized supply chain could reduce eutrophication, conserve phosphate rock resources, and enhance global agricultural production."

In this context, industrial production processes are changing thanks to the development of green strategies. The selection of a new production solution is a crucial strategic decision and the introduction of new technologies could cause deep changes to the entire supply chain configuration. This paper introduces a new approach designed to understand the importance of supply chain considerations for a suitable technology assessment. It is aimed at proposing a quantitative model for the evaluation of different structure of supply chains based on different production technologies. In particular, by defining a set of Key Performance Indicators and applying a multi-criteria decision method, a final score is computed, giving important information about both environmental and economic aspects. A numerical example regarding the comparison between Additive and Traditional Manufacturing processes is presented in order to demonstrate the applicability and the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that additive solutions bring evident reduction in Carbon Emission and better supply chain and logistics performance. Anyway, production volume strongly influences the economic results and the competitiveness of additive manufacturing remains limited when compared to the traditional manufacturing."

Fulfilling this increased complexity of consumer demand has required supply chains to evolve into multienterprise networks with numerous flow paths in production, merchandising, and fulfillment involving many organizational/institutional handoffs, to effectively manage a large number of complex products with shorter life cycles and high transaction volumes. The supply chain management models of today place higher demands on automation and require a transition from the traditional paradigm of planning followed by long-loop execution for a handful of segments to a paradigm of managing a portfolio of end-To-end instrumented data-rich microsegmented supply chains that are monitored and adjusted in near real time. These essential aspects and challenges of supply chain management require the supporting information technology to also evolve. In this paper, we propose a novel reference software architecture to address the complex requirements of modern supply chains that also integrates blockchain into several layers of the stack. We present several examples where this reference architecture is applicable, and then demonstrate through a use case in production that integrating blockchain technology helps with providing visibility, documenting provenance, and allowing permissioned data access to facilitate the automation of many high-volume tasks such as reconciliations, payments, and settlements."

By analyzing the pricing, service, recycling decisions, and the profit of the supply chain members in different remanufacturing modes, it is shown that the FR remanufacturing mode not only promotes the retailer to improve the product service level, but also enables the third-party to improve the recovery rate. When the consumer's acceptance degree of remanufactured products reaches a certain level, relative to the MR and UR re-manufacturing modes, the FR remanufacturing model enables manufacturers, retailers, and third-party to simultaneously maximize profits.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors follow a grounded theory approach for theory building based on interviews with senior managers of 15 organizations positioned across multiple echelons in the RSC. Findings: Findings reveal how user involvement shapes BDPA to fit organizational structures and how changes made to the technology retroactively affect its design and institutional properties. Findings also reveal previously unreported aspects of BDPA use for LSCM. These include the presence of temporal and spatial discontinuities in the technology use across RSC organizations. Practical implications: This study unveils that it is impossible to design a BDPA technology ready for immediate use. The emergent process framework shows that institutional and social factors require BDPA use specific to the organization, as the technology comes to reflect the properties of the organization and the wider social environment for which its designers originally intended. BDPA is, thus, not easily transferrable among collaborating RSC organizations and requires managerial attention to the institutional context within which its usage takes place.

Second, extant i4.0 solutions rely mostly on analytics and smart things while omitting smart people technology and the human-centric approach associated with the i4.0 paradigm. Third, established companies adopt i4.0 merely to sustain their existing business architectures while startup companies radically change their operating models, relying heavily on data analytics and the platform economy. Consequently, established companies pursue a problem-driven, engineering-based approach to SCI while startup companies follow an ‘asset-light’, business-driven approach.

The emergence of RFID technology offers a possible solution to alleviate the growing cost of inventory inaccuracy. By making full use of RFID technology, this paper attempts to compare the inventory inaccuracy impact on bullwhip effect in terms of order variance amplification and supply chain performance under two scenarios: (1) all members are aware of the inaccuracy and optimize their operations; (2) all members deploy RFID technology to reduce inventory inaccuracy. Informed order policy is used as benchmark to capture the true RFID value and differentiate two types of RFID impacts, prevention and visibility, to provide more manageable insight. In particular, the incentive of sharing information in supply chain is also provided by comparing the cost of two supply chain settings."

Particularly, the game equilibrium in the cooperation between the smart supply chain platform and the cooperative under the subsidy and non-subsidy mechanisms of the government was analyzed. Finally, numerical simulation was implemented to analyze the effects of risks, intelligence degree, consumer preference and price on game equilibrium. The study results demonstrate: (1) In the range allowed by technology and cost, increasing the intelligence degree of the smart supply chain platform will benefit the cooperation between the smart supply chain platform and the cooperative; (2) Under high unsalable risks and unsalable losses, the cooperative will cooperate with the smart supply chain platform; (3) consumer preference influences not only the cooperative game between smart supply chain and cooperative, but also product demand and product price; and (4) under constant conditions, dependence on government subsidies is inversely proportional to the intelligence degree. In other words, enhancing the intelligence degree of the smart supply chain platform helps to transform the ”blood transfusion” poverty alleviation to “hematopoietic” poverty alleviation, and decreases the dependence of poverty alleviation on government financial platform subsidies."

In this paper, a coordination mechanism was examined by focusing on the freshness-keeping effort of third-party logistics service providers (TPLSPs) in a three-echelon cold supply chain. Optimal decisions concerning a carbon trading mechanism were examined based on a comparison of two decision systems: a decentralized system and a centralized system. An incentive scheme was proposed to motivate all three parties in a decentralized system to adopt the coordinated mechanism with self-regulation. The results of numerous experiments show that although an increased eco-friendliness effort would reduce market demand, total carbon emissions, and the supplier's profit, a reasonable revenue-and-cost-sharing contract can improve sales volume and balance the supply chain members' profit. With a coordination model, all members in the supply chain can benefit from Pareto improvement. Other proposals were also examined in the scheme. The results can be implemented into decision making on cold and green supply chain and proved a tool to realize Industry 4.0 from the viewpoint of smart logistics."

The current predominantly ""large batch"" and centralized manufacturing system designed for the ""blockbuster"" drug has driven a slow-paced, inventory heavy operating model that is increasingly regarded as inflexible and unsustainable. Indeed, new markets and the rapidly evolving technology landscape will drive more product variety, shorter product life-cycles, and smaller drug volumes, which will exacerbate an already unsustainable economic model. Future supply chains will be required to enhance affordability and availability for patients and healthcare providers alike despite the increased product complexity. In this more challenging supply scenario, we examine the potential for a more pull driven, near real-time demand-based supply chain, utilizing continuous processing where appropriate as a key element of a more ""flow-through"" operating model. In this discussion paper on future supply chain models underpinned by developments in the continuous manufacture of pharmaceuticals, we have set out; · The significant opportunities to moving to a supply chain flow-through operating model, with substantial opportunities in inventory reduction, lead-time to patient, and radically different product assurance/stability regimes. · Scenarios for decentralized production models producing a greater variety of products with enhanced volume flexibility. · Production, supply, and value chain footprints that are radically different from today's monolithic and centralized batch manufacturing operations. · Clinical trial and drug product development cost savings that support more rapid scale-up and market entry models with early involvement of SC designers within New Product Development. · The major supply chain and industrial transformational challenges that need to be addressed. The paper recognizes that although current batch operational performance in pharma is far from optimal and not necessarily an appropriate end-state benchmark for batch technology, the adoption of continuous supply chain operating models underpinned by continuous production processing, as full or hybrid solutions in selected product supply chains, can support industry transformations to deliver right-first-time quality at substantially lower inventory profiles."

Our three hypotheses are confirmed, indicating that the community cloud exerts a positive and significant effect both on the informational-physical integration of the supply chain and on operational performance. The value of this study lies in the fact that it enables academics and practitioners to understand which parts of a relatively new technology (cloud technology and its sub-types) might contribute to integrating flows in the supply chain and, ultimately, impacting operational performance."

Design/methodology/approach: The three-step mediation analysis was performed using SPSS macro PROCESS to assess the mediating role of process simplification on the relationship between process integration constructs: top management commitment and supplier relationship; and upstream supply chain flexibility. Findings: The results indicate a complete mediation effect of process simplification between supplier relationship and upstream supply chain flexibility, while partial mediation effect is noticed between top management commitment and upstream supply chain flexibility. Practical implications: For Indian automotive managers, the study suggests that for improving the upstream supply chain flexibility, organizations must have a strategy towards improving the simplification of supply chain processes by upgrading technology and providing training to their suppliers. This understanding will help the automotive managers to simplify their upstream supply chain processes for gaining competitive positioning and maximizing the organizational profit.

However, limited research focuses on the context of humanitarian supply chains. This calls to develop structural models that can scrutinize the technology adoption behaviour of the users in the humanitarian context. Therefore, this study is an attempt to empirically examine the technology adoption behaviour of humanitarian organizations. It extends the unified theory of the acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model by integrating personal innovativeness and trust in technology with the behavioural intention to adopt technology in the humanitarian context. Data from 192 humanitarian practitioners, who have experienced a large number of disasters, is utilized to empirically validate the conceptual model. The structural equation modelling results show that - out of four constructs namely performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions under UTAUT - performance expectancy and effort expectancy significantly affect the IT adoption. Contrary to expectations, trust and personal innovation do not affect the behavioural intention. Also, personal innovation does not moderate the relationship between performance expectancy and effort expectancy. This underlines the need to foster a learning culture within these organizations. The efforts made by involved humanitarian organizations may be directed towards improving the level of education, skills and facilitating them with other resources such as appropriate IT and data mining training, so that the technology adoption becomes an integral part of their daily activities. Finally, detailed implications for humanitarian organizations are discussed."

We propose that firms adopt a broader heuristic for making new product development choices. Our heuristic approach requires moving beyond traditional finance-based thinking, and suggests that firms concentrate on technological trajectories by combining technology roadmapping, information technology (IT) and supply chain management to make more sustainable new product development decisions. Using the proposed holistic heuristic methods, versus relying on traditional finance-based decision-making tools (e.g., emphasizing net present value or internal rate of return projections), enables firms to plan beyond the short-term and immediate set of technologies at hand. Our proposed heuristic approach enables firms to forecast technologies and markets, and hence, new product priorities in the longer term. Investments in new products should, as a result, generate returns over a longer period than traditionally expected, giving firms more sustainable investments. New products are costly and need to have a durable presence in the market. Transaction costs and resources will be saved, as firms make new product development decisions less frequently. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

That is, most supply chains are no longer limited to a particular region. Because the numbers of branch nodes of supply chains have increased, products and raw materials vary and resource constraints differ. Thus, integrating planning mechanisms should include the capacity to respond to change. In the past, mathematical programming and a general heuristics algorithm were used to solve globalized supply chain network design problems. When mathematical programming is used to solve a problem and the number of decision variables is too high or constraint conditions are too complex, computation time is long, resulting in low efficiency, and can easily become trapped in partial optimum solution. When a general heuristics algorithm is used and the number of variables and constraints is too high, the degree of complexity increases. This usually results in an inability of people to think about resource constraints of enterprises and obtain an optimum solution. Therefore, this study uses genetic algorithms with optimum search features. This work combines the co-evolutionary mode, which is in accordance with various criteria and evolves dynamically, and constraint-satisfaction mode capacity to narrow the search space, which helps in finding rapidly a solution that, solves supply chain integration network design problems. Additionally, via mathematical programming, a simple genetic algorithm, co-evolutionary genetic algorithm, constraint-satisfaction genetic algorithm and co-evolutionary constraint genetic algorithm are used to compare the experiments result and processing time to confirm the performance of the proposed method. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

These emerging technologies require a specific approach to technology, supplier and enterprise communication development. However, a global strategy for aerospace supply-chains is difficult to develop, specifically for new manufacturing technologies. Within large aerospace companies, it is challenging to assess emerging technologies with respect to manufacturing readiness level and risk. The research provided discusses a technique used to assess risk coupled with manufacturing readiness level maturation for emerging technologies using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Developing customer requirements for a new manufacturing technology is challenging when multiple customers exist for the proposed technology. Technology experts are found within the company and executive champions are solicited to assist in sponsoring the emerging technology. This research covers proven heuristics developed for marketing the emerging technology throughout the aerospace enterprise. Also, the experience level of the supplier to adopt the emerging technology acts as a critical element in defining a deployment strategy within the aerospace company. Once manufacturing technologies are developed, communicating the emerging technology is necessary. Supplier involvement, supply chain flexibility, and enterprise communication strategies are highlighted with respect to a global supply-chain for aerospace. © 2011 Taylor & Francis."

Considering the consumer market demand and downstream investment conditions as input, we model a game in a two-tier supply chain where downstream firms choose to adopt different levels of an upstream technology and an upstream technology leader determines its pricing policy. We identify two necessary but distinct elements for the successful development, adoption, and diffusion of upstream technologies that are sold to lower tiers as components within final products. (1) The level of technology demanded by the market: We develop a measure, Technological Potential, which describes the highest level of an upstream technology demanded by consumer markets. (2) A sufficiently rich return to an upstream innovator, as a function of different levels of technology. From these two elements, we show that the relative magnitudes of two competing sets of consumer market factors determine the Technological Potential whereas the overall magnitude of the factors in both sets determines the return to the upstream developer. We discuss how this difference in consumer market factors’ influence on these two elements may determine how different technologies fare in the supply chain. Our results have managerial implications for: investors in research and development project selection in identifying profitable technologies that are also demanded at higher capability levels; and for governments in defining more targeted public policies – for example in choosing the right tier of a supply chain to provide subsidies – to encourage market support for certain technologies."

Background: Supply chain sustainability is a central concern of most organizations. The main objective of sustainable supply chains is to create and maintain long term economic, social, and environmental value for all stakeholders involved in delivering products and services to markets. As sustainability constitutes one of the critical drivers of innovation, the recent emergence of blockchain technology typifies the disruptive impact of digital innovation on supply chain sustainability. Blockchain is a foundational technology that poses a shift in the development of supply chain sustainability. Methods: Despite the increasing importance of blockchain in improving supply chain efficiencies and bringing societal changes, research investigating its potentialities from the lens of sustainability is scarce. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to fill this knowledge gap and synthesize the literature from leading journals on the topic of blockchain and its relation to supply chain sustainability. Papers were collected from different scientific databases and carefully analyzed. The possibilities of blockchains are identified and classified according to the triple bottom line framework, namely the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Results and conclusions: The majority of studies focused on the economic implications of blockchains on supply chains. The sustainable economic aspects of the technology identified in the reviewed literature are mostly the transformational potentials of blockchains and their capabilities to drive new disintermediated business models, higher operational efficiencies, cost advantages, and additional sources of value creation. The social empowerment of supply chains is found through the ability of blockchain to create trustful relationships among supply chain partners, increase food safety, support humanitarian logistics, and promote social equity. Moreover, firms attempting to move forward in their environmental policies and strategies can use blockchain to extend their efforts to improve their environmental practices across the supply chain, reduce the strain on energy and natural resources, and offer environmentally friendly products."

This paper provides a conceptual foundation to address this gap and develops a comprehensive model of the risks of customer participation in service delivery, integrating research from the marketing, operations and supply chain management, strategy, and information technology fields. Design/methodology/approach: The model is derived deductively by integrating insights from research in marketing, operations and supply chain management, strategy, and information technology. Findings: This paper identifies three categories of potential risks of CP (i.e. market, operational, and service network) and discusses ways that firms can mitigate these risks. Building on the model, it develops a CP risk assessment tool that managers can use when evaluating increases in CP. Research limitations/implications: The conceptual model proposed in this paper can serve as a robust basis for future research in customer participation, particularly in such areas as sharing economy services, service delivery networks, and experiential services. The risk assessment tool offers clear guidelines for managers who are considering an increase in customer participation in their service. Originality/value: This is the first attempt to conceptually define customer participation risk and develop a comprehensive model of its drivers and strategies to mitigate it.

Establishes that companies with higher levels of AMT implementation collaborate more with their parts suppliers and companies are more successful in achieving their AMT implementation objectives if increased AMT implementation is coupled with more collaborative supplier relationships. Both AMT implementation levels and buyer-supplier collaboration are shown to have significantly increased over a five-year period. While AMT implementation levels of individual firms appear to have diverged, levels of buyer-supplier collaboration appear to have converged during the five years."

Eight accessory suppliers (first tier in the supply chain, such as: heels, buckles, and decorative ornaments), eight footwear manufacturing companies (footwear manufacturer or assembly companies), four retail companies, and four IT service providers. The research techniques used were semi-structured interviews, direct observation, and document analysis. The data analysis showed benefits and impediments to the integration of IT in the studied supply chain. It was found that two IT integration models have been adopted by the computer service providers: Proprietary (accessible only to the service providers) and Open (accessible to all companies) models. Although closed, the proprietary IT integration model is widely used given its simplicity and low cost. On the other hand, the Open Model enables higher organization in the internal processes of the IT management, inventory management, and production. The results obtained contribute to the literature since they show ways to improve Footwear Supply Chain development by increasing the speed and providing more productive flexibility to this sector. Although attractive, these developments can be hindered by commercial ventures of companies that adopt the Proprietary Model.

Built upon a synthesis of the existing literature and relevant theories, this paper presents a research model that defines the drivers, strategy, and practices of a responsive supply chain and the performance outcomes. This paper is one of the rare empirical studies that identify key variables relevant to the implementation of a successful responsive supply chain. The effective implementation of a responsive supply chain requires a careful definition of a responsive supply chain strategy in terms of the product range, and the frequency and innovativeness of the product offerings. Firms also need to provide key implementation practices (i.e.; sharing of information with customers, collaboration with suppliers, use of advanced manufacturing technology) to achieve pull production to achieve responsiveness to the market. This study also suggests that the key contextual factors that influence the extent of implementation of a responsive supply chain strategy are mostly the size of firms, industry characteristics, and customer and supplier bases, rather than the location of manufacturing firms. This paper shows that the effective implementation of a responsive supply chain strategy involves the integration of inter-organizational resources (i.e.; socio-relational and techno-process integration) across the global supply chain to enhance pull production capabilities. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

In most countries, blood management information systems, led by national institutions, operate centrally. However, existing centralized blood management systems have limitations in that they lack detailed blood information and, moreover, information is not reflected in real time. To solve this problem, this paper presents an innovative blood cold chain system based on blockchain technology. The proposed system aims to increase information visibility by recording the overall information on the blood supply and providing detailed blood information such as blood consumption and disposal to the distributed ledger. In addition, this paper proposes direct blood transactions between medical institutions in cases of emergency. Currently, blockchain technologies are being actively employed in the supply chain management and medical fields in addition to financial systems. Particularly, private blockchain techniques with limited participants are relatively fast and reliable, making them suitable for B2B (Business-to-Business) transactions. Therefore, the proposed system is based on the architecture of Hyperledger Fabric, a private blockchain technology implemented by the Hyperledger Composer tool. Information in the proposed blood cold chain system cannot be forged or tampered with, and information recorded and shared in real time is kept transparent. In addition, allowing for B2B blood transaction in special circumstances will minimize the blood supply time and enable patients to be transfused quickly.

Establishing the right sourcing strategy for recycled material, therefore, is crucial for supply chains and for managing corporate sustainability tensions. We analyse the transaction costs in three strategic models of sourcing from ‘make’ inside the supply chain to contract, and ‘buy’ in the grey market for metals. ‘Blood metals’ leak into the grey markets when there is lack of control, information asymmetry in global supply chains and eco-opportunism in recycling of electronic products. Consequently, the need for traceable supply encourages companies to integrate closed-loop recycling of their products. Furthermore, scarcity of valuable metals along with consumer preferences for sustainable products lead to specific investments in product design and robot technology that disassemble end-of-life products. Together, these factors provide an integrated system that reduces transaction costs and increases recycling efficiency. Therefore, specific assets designed to facilitate reuse of scarce metals like the Apple robot Daisy is a key corporate strategy to secure sustainable performance. Specific investments in disassembling technology like robots in the smartphone industry, should, according to transaction cost theory, be organised as a vertically integrated circular economy. The integrated closed-loop model presented here, control eco-opportunism and the unsustainable character of grey markets for recycled material in electronics."

The unfortunate consequence of this approach is the bullwhip effect. An alternative approach is some form of collaborative scenario. Unfortunately, neither approach guarantees optimisation across the supply chain. The fundamental reason for this is found in the rational behaviour that participants in the process adhere to. As it is impossible to suppress rational behaviour, a solution for this problem is sought through orchestration and rigorous implementation of the Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR) process. A technology framework that promises to facilitate this objective is a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based on web services. However a new paradigm, more suited to collaborative business scenarios, is needed. Pi-calculus, coupled with business process modelling and web services, seem to offer a solution.

MTSCs in this country are under pressure from health service funding and cheaper imports, primarily from China. Consequently, supply chain success is of high importance and OEM operational improvements are critical. This exploratory study involved a multiple case study approach where 15 OEMs within German MTSCs were investigated. Following within-case and cross-case analysis, empirical results led to the development of testable propositions, which constitute a foundation for further research investigation. The findings show that there are six, prioritized Critical Success Factors for MTSCs that include sales and operations planning, product development process and quality and compliance. These findings challenge existing assumptions about Critical Success Factors within MTSCs, providing practitioners with strategies showing that re-prioritized CSFs should improve the operational performance of OEMs."

Exploring these questions can contribute knowledge to the field of operations management: how firms can employ their IT capabilities for operations and supply chain management, the impact of competitive and institutional environments on IT-based operations strategy; the relationships between IT-enabled supply chain practices and operations performance. This paper addresses these aspects by examining the factors affecting Chinese firms' adoption of IT-enabled supply chain operations and the benefits they achieve, by drawing from and integrating the resource-based and institutional theoretic perspectives. It identifies key organizational and institutional factors that influence firms' technology adoption for supply chain management. Results show that firms can benefit by incorporating the technology within their internal operations processes and by using the technology externally with partners in their supply chain trading community. The results provide evidence that firms' IT engagement for operations and supply chain management is significantly influenced by institutional factors. Association analysis was conducted to understand the potential influence of external diffusion on internal assimilation. The result supports the theoretical claim. Building on the existing literature, this study demonstrates how resource-based theory and institutional theory can provide a solid theoretical backbone for practitioners, researchers, and policy makers in efforts pertaining to technology adoption for operational supply chain excellence. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

As people gradually realize the importance of the environment, low carbon has become one of the core indicators of power system evaluation, so it is particularly important to guide the coal enterprises to achieve a win-win situation of economic and environmental benefits. Combined with the carbon emission policies, this paper takes the coal supply chain network as the research object and aims to develop a comprehensive decision model for sustainable design of coal supply chain. First, this paper extracts the influencing factors of low-carbonization in coal supply chain and constructs an interpretative structural model (ISM). The results show that low-carbon green technology, low-carbon production cost, utilization level of green energy and energy efficiency are the most basic manifestations of low-carbonization of coal supply chain and interact with each other, therefore this paper builds an optimization model with the objective of minimizing the low-carbon production costs in the coal supply chain. Concurrently, this paper introduces four policies (emission cap, carbon tax, carbon trade and carbon offset) as constraint condition. Then, in the aspect of model solving, this paper combines the differential evolution (DE) strategy to mutate, cross and select the leaders generated in each iteration of the salp swarm algorithm (SSA), further increases the diversity of the salp swarm, avoids the algorithm falling into a local optimum, and proposes the salp swarm algorithm based on differential evolution (DE-SSA). Finally, this paper compares the effects of four different carbon emission policies on the optimization of coal supply chain network through empirical analysis, and finds that coal enterprises have the best emission reduction effect under the carbon trade policy. The development and implementation of this paper not only enriches the related research of efficient supply chain, but also provides scientific and quantifiable decision-making technology for coal enterprises."

DfRem activities occur at the stage of new product design but have a significant impact on subsequent remanufacturing operations. Based on the closed-loop supply chain operation systems with DfRem, we systematically explored the impact of DfRem on supply chain operation decisions through a case study and modeling analysis and built up a modeling research framework of DfRem-driven closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) operation decision-making. Our research identified DfRem-driven model design elements and discussed the modeling of DfRem-driven investment decision problems, involving different approaches to obtain DfRem investment (i.e., DfRem-driven horizontal or vertical supply chain cooperation) and the ownership of DfRem-level decision-making rights. Moreover, the DfRem-driven two-stage and multi-period modeling processes are elaborated in detail. The aim of this paper is to provide other scholars with a more comprehensive understanding of DfRem research issues, and to establish an integrated DfRem-driven research framework for subsequent scholars to better conduct modeling research on DfRem."

In this paper, we evaluate the impact of clean technology adoption and environmental taxes on the TA supply chains. First, we consider a monopoly case, where a two-echelon supply chain consists of one buyer and one manufacturer. We find that raising the environmental tax rate motivates the manufacturer to invest in green technologies. We then extend our model to examine the duopoly case. We find that in the duopoly case, if the buyer's market share is sufficiently small (large), the optimal greenness level for this buyer's product decreases (increases) in the environmental tax rate; whereas if the two products market shares are relatively equal, the optimal greenness levels for both products buyers increase in the environmental tax rate. The existence of the spillover effect reduces the cost and improves the product greenness. Consumer welfare can be improved if the efficiency of green technology adoption and the coefficient of greenness level on market demand are sufficiently high. This result implies that if the government cares about consumers, the manufacturer should be encouraged to enhance the cost reduction ability in terms of green technology, and consumer education about sustainability consciousness should be enhanced."

Manufacturers can motivate suppliers to increase sustainability investment level through various types of contracts, such as price commitment and cost-sharing contracts. In this context, we consider a two-echelon sustainable supply chain with a manufacturer and a supplier. We use price commitment as basis to study several scenarios, such as centralized/decentralized decision system, pure price commitment contract, commitment to wholesale price and cost-sharing contract, and two-part tariff contract. Accordingly, we mainly discuss if these contracts can improve the sustainability investment level of suppliers and if Pareto improvement can be achieved. Results show that the pure price commitment contract can neither improve suppliers sustainability investment level nor coordinate the supply chain. By contrast, with a combination on price and sharing ratio, commitment to wholesale price with cost sharing is beneficial in enhancing suppliers sustainability investment level and can achieve the Pareto improvement in profit for supply chain members. Lastly, numerical results reveal that main contract parameters, such as basic wholesale price, sensitivity of wholesale price to sustainability investment level, and coefficient of sustainability effect, greatly influence the profits of supply chain members. The commitment to wholesale price with cost-sharing contract can likewise achieve the Pareto improvement in a certain condition."

It should be noted that the six-dimensional (6D) sustainability model used in this study will be a useful and comprehensive model for industries. Since, the new dimension of IT along with the five well-known economic, social, environmental, technical and institutional aspects of organizations is considered to have great impacts on supply chain sustainability; the proposed framework can be practical. Design/methodology/approach According to the related literature review, there are two research streams in supply chain management. The first stream is exploratory research, seeking out conceptual discussions in this area. The second one is associated with mathematical models and techniques, aiming to set decision-making rules in this regard (Agrell et al., 2004). In this study, evaluation was performed using the FMEA method as an analytical technique based on the principle of pre-occurrence prevention to identify potential failure factors in sensitive systems (Mohammadfam and Kianfari, 2008). Findings After identifying the risks and causes of the incidence and effects and consequences of risks, preventive and risk control measures and advisory strategies were presented. Customers with 45.76% share in critical risks are threatening to maintain supply chain in these companies. During this study, it was found that 33.9% of the main source of supply chain critical risks was customers, constituting 45.76% of such risks, accompanied by organization, having a 38.88% share of critical risk generation. The study findings also revealed that 33.9% of critical risks were mainly (equally) related to economic and technical aspects of supply chain sustainability in telecommunication networks. Moreover, as a newly-introduced sixth dimension, IT represented 10.17% of critical risks threatening supply chain sustainability in such networks. Critical risks are mainly related to the economic and technical aspects (equally) with the sustainability of the telecommunication networks supply chain. Also, as a new finding and the sixth dimension, 10.17% of the critical risks that threaten the sustainability of the telecommunication networks supply chain have the information technology dimension. Originality/value The internet and fixed and mobile data services are provided by several private companies in Iran, which are relatively similar in terms of their supply chains. In order to manage the sustainability of Iran's telecommunication supply chain, telecommunication networks affiliated to Iran Telecommunication Company (ITC), operating in the field of data and internet services and fixed telephone were selected in 31 provinces. The intended networks were also providing an important part of the country's needs including Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran, a subsidiary of Iran's telecommunication networks, as one of the top companies in this industry. Accordingly, all the networks studied in this study needed to be identified with regard to communication sustainability risks, since they provide management solutions to each other by segregating risks. In this study, 68 managers and 72 experts participated in different work teams of telecommunication networks."

Specifically, the research develops a two-dimensional measure of supplier transparency that builds on previous studies that independently examine visibility and traceability in supply chain management (SCM)/logistics. Design/methodology/approach: The scale development process is carried out over three stages (item generation, scale purification, scale validation). Survey methods are used with two separate data collection phases involving a total of 358 managers from multiple and diverse industries. Findings: The new supplier transparency measure is a concise, two-dimensional scale that has the potential for significant usage in the development and testing of SCM theory. Research limitations/implications: This study implemented a purposefully general sampling procedure. However, different industries may have additional, specific constraints regarding what it means to be a transparent supplier. Additional opportunities for future research include applying the new supplier transparency measure to examine supply chain frameworks, regulatory compliance, supply chain relationships and the implementation of information technology. Practical implications: Firms are under increasing pressure to be transparent about partner sourcing, resource utilization and other transactional issues related to the products and processes in their supply chains. The new measure may be utilized to address these issues as well as the interaction between supply chain operations and stakeholders by facilitating a quantitative assessment of supplier transparency. Originality/value: Drawing on the established constructs of supply chain visibility and traceability, a measure of supplier transparency is developed, supported by a review of the literature, input from subject matter experts and interviews with supply chain managers. Suggestions are made for future validation of supplier transparency within established supply chain frameworks."

From the analysis we conclude that the wind power industry has experienced a decoupling process of the offshore supply chain from its onshore counterpart with diverging technological requirements. For policy-makers, it is essential to acknowledge that barriers to adoption and the consequent needs for subsidies among the players in the onshore and offshore supply chains seem to differ, and that a micro-level analysis of the innovations and risks involved at the various stages in the supply chain is necessary."

This task is made challenging in part because of the tendency of new technologies to traverse a sequentially downward path of gradually lowering costs and prices, which limits their initial availability and affordability, crimping market coverage and revenues. Academic/practical relevance: We focus on the product management challenge of juggling revenues and profits, show how it is amplified in a supply chain, and propose a new degree of freedom in a supply chain, namely innovation investment anchoring, that offers product managers and their firms the ability to expand market coverage and improve both revenues and profits. Methodology: We adopt a sequential game theory approach to analyze the investment anchor decision for various objectives from investments in innovation to market coverage to profit. Results: We find that the investment anchoring approach can lead to greater investments in innovation, revenues, and profits. We also compare the investment anchoring for two types of innovation, product quality improvement and cost reduction, and show that the investment anchoring is more effective for product quality improvement. Managerial implications: Our findings have subtle but important implications for firms launching innovative products and aspiring to expand product sales and profits. Specifically, innovating firms in a supply chain by broadening the quest for an investment anchor and offering them incentives to invest as well as fine tuning the level of innovation investment with the market context can make innovation more inclusive, alleviate supply chain distortions, and streamline revenues and profits."

Lead companies, often retailers, introduce this technology for specific objectives, such as assuring traceability or improving sales and reputation. At the same time, the technology could impact much more broadly the performances of food chains. Little is known about this impact as the evidence provided in the literature is scarce and mostly focused on specific indicators. This paper addresses this gap assessing the impact of the blockchain technology on food supply chains from an explorative perspective. An integrated conceptual framework is proposed which includes a broad set of performance dimensions discussed in the literature: efficiency, flexibility, responsiveness, food quality, and transparency of supply chains. These dimensions are assessed using a case study, consisting of three supply chains where a large European retailer has promoted the blockchain adoption. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with key managers at different stages of the three supply chains and were systematically analysed through a thematic analysis. Results reveal that blockchain technology impacts positively on the profit and/or return on investment of supply chains, it leads to an increase of extrinsic food quality attributes and it fosters a better information management along the food chains due to an improved information accessibility, availability and sharing. The current analysis also suggests an improved management of behavioural uncertainty among the agents of the supply chains and an increase of firm's knowledge as well as supply chain management competencies. While the study remains of explorative nature, it offers a basis for the selection of theoretical approaches and the formulation of new hypotheses for future blockchain studies."

Despite the widely publicized environmental impacts, however, the industry continues to grow, in part due to the rise of fast fashion, which relies on cheap manufacturing, frequent consumption and short-lived garment use. In this Review, we identify the environmental impacts at critical points in the textile and fashion value chain, from production to consumption, focusing on water use, chemical pollution, CO2 emissions and textile waste. Impacts from the fashion industry include over 92 million tonnes of waste produced per year and 1.5 trillion litres of water consumed. On the basis of these environmental impacts, we outline the need for fundamental changes in the fashion business model, including a deceleration of manufacturing and the introduction of sustainable practices throughout the supply chain, as well a shift in consumer behaviour — namely, decreasing clothing purchases and increasing garment lifetimes. These changes stress the need for an urgent transition back to ‘slow’ fashion, minimizing and mitigating the detrimental environmental impacts, so as to improve the long-term sustainability of the fashion supply chain. The increase in clothing consumption, exemplified in fast fashion, has severe environmental consequences. This Review discusses the impacts of fashion on natural resources and the environment, and examines how technology, policy and consumer behaviour can mitigate the negative effects of the fashion industry."

This paper studies the effects of VMI on a supply chain consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer to shed light on when an IT investment for VMI adoption can be justified. We show that whether the two supply chain members benefit from VMI depends on how the holding or shortage cost increment from the manufacturer to retailer compares with two corresponding critical values. We then develop comparative statics results on how these critical values change with respect to different parameters. Interestingly, the retailer is more likely to benefit from the adoption of VMI when its inventory holding cost is low, and the manufacturer is more likely to benefit from VMI adoption when its inventory holding cost is high, contradicting what our intuitions would suggest and what has been prescribed in the literature."

In this exploratory case study, we scrutinized the management of medicines waste in a hospital from an information systems perspective and examined how information systems are used to manage the medicine supply chain and medicine waste. Our research case was a Finnish university hospital, its central pharmacy, and, more widely, the medicine supply chain within the hospital. Methods: This is a qualitative case study, based on data gathered through interviews and a survey and a review of other information sources, including annual reports and other relevant collateral. The study participants included pharmacy staff members and other hospital staff involved in medicine supply. The interviews were conducted in two rounds, first capturing the main themes and then exploring them further in the later study stages. Results: The findings outline a picture of unfit technology and inconsistent and unreliable information. This is compensated for by manual practices and processes that cause an excessive administrative burden and ultimately increased wastage. An infrequent ordering process combined with the lack of recycling practices increase the wastage even more. Conclusion: Medicine supply and waste management remain a manual administrative task. Inconsistent information and unfit information systems make this task challenging, and the process relies on the medicine supply staff's experience and assumptions."

First of all, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) was adopted to analyze the potential or existing hazards of all links in the general table grape supply chain in order to determine the traceability unit (TRU). Secondly, multi-sensors and barcode technology were used to automatically collect the critical ambient data in the table grape supply chain, such as temperature, relative humidity (RH), O2 concentration and SO2 concentration. And it contributed to reduce human errors and improve data accuracy. Finally, in order to ensure symmetry and security of the traceability information, blockchain technology was introduced to implement traceability system by using the platform of Ethereum and Java development. Based on the table grape supply chain quality and safety traceability system, all data on critical links would not be changed once added to the ledger of blockchain, and the security of information resources was guaranteed, thus the source of table grape can be traced and traceable."

Unlike the well-developed supply chain finance (SCF) using guarantees provided by a core enterprise, the effectiveness of SCF with self-guarantee is unclear, especially in a multi-sided market setting. The current paper explores this effectiveness by building an analytical model involving four kinds of players: a multi-sided platform, a customer, a bank, and multiple transportation service providers. In this setting, a traditional SCF model with Platform Undertakes Guarantee (PUG) and a novel SCF strategy with self-guarantee (i.e. Customer Undertakes Guarantee (CUG)) are analysed. The results indicate that CUG can bring a Pareto improvement for the market compared to PUG. Although CUG displays higher efficiency, it is not always beneficial to the platform when the customer's opportunity cost rate is higher than the platform's. Furthermore, to mitigate credit risk caused by a low-credit customer, the platform may employ a prepayment strategy. Analytical results of this study indicate that the prepayment ratio does not affect the customer's cost, and thus, providing a high prepayment ratio but a relatively low service fee rate to low-credit customers is suggested to the platform."

Where many previous studies have identified technology as the key determinant, we argue that operational and behavioural perspectives should be duly taken into consideration while adopting e-technology. Therefore, inspired by the systems engineering principles, we propose a generic framework for evaluating business performance of e-supply chain companies. A questionnaire was designed and survey data from 208 Malaysian SMEs was collected. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed to test the impact of Supply Chain Strategy, E-Business Adoption, and the interaction of these constructs, on overall Business Performance. With regards to the operational perspective the results suggest that E-Business Adoption relates more positively to Business Performance compared to Supply Chain Strategy construct. Also, Technology Capability scored relatively higher compared to Organisational Capability and Attitudinal Capability. Overall Supply Chain Relationship (behavioural perspective) demonstrates a relatively weak result. Our findings suggest that where Malaysian SMEs are technology orientated, however, they need to develop efficient logistics networks to cater for a geographically dispersed population. Also, they need to pay serious attention towards 'softer' issues, in that to bring about attitudinal changes that allow developing closer collaboration with their supply chain companies. We argue that operational and behavioural perspectives can be embedded within the systems engineering principles that provide necessary theoretical underpinning for conducting such a research. The empirical findings provide useful guidelines for SMEs that wish to embark upon an e-business adoption journey. Furthermore, the measures produced here can be used as a benchmarking exercise for the SMEs who have already adopted e-technology."

Practitioners and researchers alike who take a relational perspective widely regard supplier involvement as a potentially effective strategy to cope with technology uncertainty, as focal manufacturers can tap into their upstream supply networks for complementary resources and capabilities. However, the literature lacks a nuanced understanding of the supplier involvement processes. Specifically, the role of resource dependence for supplier involvement has yet to be systematically understood. To fill this gap, this study aims to combine the relational perspective with the resource-dependence perspective to explore how buyer dependence, supplier dependence and buyer–supplier interdependence influence buyers’ decision-making on tapping into upstream supply networks for coping with technology uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach: To test the hypotheses, a survey is conducted among Dutch firms with more than 50 employees in the discrete manufacturing industries (ISIC 28-35), resulting in a sample of 125 manufacturers. Findings: First, there is a significantly positive relationship between technology uncertainty and supplier involvement, giving support to the expectation that buyers are indeed involving their key suppliers in the product/process design and improvement, as a response to technology uncertainty. Second, buyer dependence and interdependence are found to be positively moderating the relationship between technology uncertainty and supplier involvement. In contrast, supplier dependence has a negative moderating effect on the baseline relationship. Research limitations/implications: The authors contribute to a relational view on buyer–supplier relationships by showing that the validity of this view, in the context of technology uncertainty, is contingent on the resource dependence between buyers and suppliers, and the authors contribute to the supply chain management literature more generally by combining a relational perspective with a resource-dependence perspective. Practical implications: The findings provide several nuanced insights into the effect of resource dependence (buyer dependence, supplier dependence and interdependence) on supplier involvement for coping with technology uncertainty. Originality/value: This study contributes to the supply chain management research by going beyond the benefits of supplier involvement and highlights the circumstances under which supplier involvement is likely to occur."

In current supply chain system, information is not shared between systems, manufacturers don't know what happened to their products, drugs regulatory authority has no visibility of the system, recalls are complicated and costly, and companies cannot follow-up patients. In this paper we explain how to use blockchain technology in pharmaceutical supply chain to add traceability, visibility and security to the drugs supply system. The proposed system will be used in pharmaceutical industry to track the drugs from its manufacturing until its delivery to patient. After the usage of a drug, its effect on patient will be recorded to a database for future statistics.

Increasing business dynamics, changing customer preferences, and disruptive technological shifts pose the need for two kinds of flexibility that interenterprise information systems must address - the ability of interenterprise linkages to support changes in offering characteristics (offering flexibility) and the ability to alter linkages to partner with different supply chain players (partnering flexibility). This study explores how enterprises in supply chains may forge supply chain linkages that enable both types of flexibility jointly, and allow them to deal with ubiquitous change. Drawing on March and Simon's coordination theory, we propose two design principles: (1) advance structuring of interorganizational processes and information exchange that allows partnering organizations to be loosely coupled, and (2) IT-supported dynamic adjustment that allows enterprises to quickly sense change and adapt their supply chain linkages. This study reports on a survey of 41 supply chain relationships in the IT industry. For design principle, our empirical investigation of factors shows (1) that modular design of interconnected processes and structured data connectivity are associated with higher supply chain flexibility, and (2) that deep coordination-related knowledge is critical for supply chain flexibility. Also, sharing a broad range of information with partners is detrimental to supply chain flexibility, and organizations should instead focus on improving the quality of information shared. Fo r industry managers, the study provides clear insights for information infrastructure design. To manage their interdependencies, enterprises need to encapsulate their interconnected processes in modular chunks, and support these with IT platforms for information exchange in structured formats. Enterprises also need to nurture their execution capabilities by putting in place the information systems to process information exchanged with partners, augmenting their understanding of factors such as how partner actions need to trigger adaptive responses. For researchers, the study initiates a new stream of theorizing that focuses on the role of the information infrastructure in managing the tension between competing goals of offering flexibility and partnering flexibility. © 2005 M.E.

This study aimed to analyze green supply chain coordination through which high supply chain performance can be achieved and green improvements and customer green preferences are considered. We proposed a two-part tariff (TPT) contract involving government intervention in terms of tax or subsidy. We demonstrated that the proposed TPT contract can achieve global supply chain optimization and aid in achieving green improvement. We further illustrated that the optimal green improvement degree is influenced by green technology investment, government intervention, and additional demand from customer green preferences. We showed that stronger government intervention may not always lead to higher green improvement and government should switch from taxes to subsidies in the high green investment cost scenario. Moreover, the government can benefit from low-cost green technologies. This study indicates that appropriately planned government intervention can increase the supply chain performance and aid in achieving sustainable goals."

This was done by looking into what traceability solutions are available right now through literature review. The results from this review were then further analyzed to obtain a basis for the current state of knowledge, technical solutions and to identify possible traceability structures in the cold chain. A Decision Support Framework (DSF) was constructed for choosing a suitable technical solution. It consists of a table listing different functions and attributes of technologies and a decision-tree. The DSF created from this work will help the user to identify what kind of traceability technology and structure best suits his products. This is important, as it can often be difficult for the user to decide which technology is most beneficial for his company. That is why this decision support framework will enable him to decide what is technologically feasible, practical, economical, can sustain reputation, quality and safety of the products."

The authors test whether BDA mediates the impact of institutional response to supply chain disruption events, and information technology infrastructure capabilities (ITICs), on firm’s ability to develop risk resilience from supply chain disruption events.Design/methodology/approachThe study is based on survey data collected from 225 firms, spread across several sectors in the USA and Europe. The respondents are primarily senior and middle management professionals who have experience within the information technology (IT) and supply chain domain. Validity and reliability analyses were performed using SPSS and AMOS; and covariance-based structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesis.FindingsThe analysis reveals two significant findings. First, the authors observe that institutional experience with managing supply chain disruption events has a negative impact on firm’s ability to develop business risk resilience. However, if the organizations adopt BDA capabilities, it enables them to effectively utilize resident firm knowledge and develop supply chain risk resilience capacity. The results further suggest that BDA positively adds to an organization’s existing IT capabilities. The analysis shows that BDA mediates the impact of ITIC on the organization’s ability to develop risk resilience to supply chain disruption events.Originality/valueThis study is one of the few works that empirically validate the important role that BDA capabilities play in enabling firms develop business risk resilience from supply chain disruption events. The study further provides a counterpoint to the existing perspective within the supply chain risk management literature that institutional experience of managing past supply chain disruption events prepares the organization to deal with future disruption events. This paper adds to our understanding of how, by adopting BDA capabilities, firms can develop supply chain risk resilience from disruption events."

Supply Chain Management presents a company with the opportunity to mobilize goods and services, finances and information. The process that ensures a product reaches the consumer involves the collected effort of many players within the chain that make important decisions. These decisions are often influenced by the emerging issues within the chain; specifically, technology represents one of these issues and all players in the chain have to understand how it affects the process. The impact of supply chain technologies on business decisions cannot be understated, since it is the most dynamic aspect of business today; in this regard, managers within the supply chain know that it is not only a tool, but a paramount driver in the chain. The objective of the study was to determine the effects of emerging issues in supply chain management with a focus on supply chain technologies and how they affect business organizations today. The researcher used questionnaires to collect data. This study adopted descriptive research designs a case study of Unilever Kenya that generated both quantitative and qualitative data. The target population of this study was 60 employees of Unilever Kenya. Collected data was checked for completeness and consistencies. Content analysis was used to analyze qualitative data. The collected data was edited, coded and entered for analysis using the computer statistical package tool SPSS. Analyzed data was presented in tables. The findings the study concluded there were many types of supply chain technologies available. It was therefore the task of a company to choose a particular supply chain technology that would suit its needs. Further, the study concluded that supply chain technologies had helped cut down supply chain related costs and increase service deliveries."

Our findings suggest that rising levels of domestic consumption are related to increased carbon dioxide emissions in both advanced and emerging economies. A substantial share of CO2 emissions growth in emerging economies is accounted for by increased participation in global supply chains. However, even for countries that rapidly integrated in global production networks, such as China, rising domestic consumption accounts for the majority of territorial emissions."

Currently, the growth of natural fibre processing industries in the world has been increasingly important [2]. Processing of abundant natural fibre in both upstream and downstream productions requires effective and collaborative supply chain management in terms of information sharing. Thus, an intelligent system would be implemented in supply chain management from upstream to downstream. Based on review of 46 scientific papers discussing on types of natural fibre, process, technology, and methods, as well as application areas of natural fibre in downstream industries. According to review on different aspects in 55 scientific papers, there were 5 aspects mapped, i.e. supply chain analytics, value chain, performance, collaboration, big data, and decision support system. A concept of 4.0 industry underlies utilization of opportunities for application of supply chain analytics [3]. Upcoming research opportunities include mediating relationship in supply chain network by utilizing Internet of things (IoT) and Big data (BD), in a collaborative relationship to use information sharing. The most possibly contributing research is the development of collaboration between supply chain and genetic algorithm [4]. Integration between production and inventory planning becomes an approach that utilizes Particle swarm optimization (PSO) by developing production planning [5], and production and inventory planning [6]. There is a research opportunity in the design of intelligent supply chain for natural fibre agroindustry by implementing IoT and BD as a tool in supply chain analytics, collaboration through Collaboration prediction forecasting and replenishment (CPFR) that occurs between stakeholders with the aim of improving agroindustry supply chain performance in production integration material and inventory, and performance measurement by integrating the Value chain operation reference (VCOR) model developed in supply chain analytics.

The purpose is to develop a framework for understanding antecedents to internalizing technologies in supply chains. Design/methodology/approach – A literature review covering over 30 years of interdisciplinary research was used as the theoretical underpinning for developing the supply chain internalization model (SCIM). A series of 93 personal interviews with members of a major automotive supply chain were conducted, and detailed qualitative data collected, to identify a set of significant antecedents to technology internalization. Findings – The results of the research is an empirically derived framework, the SCIM, including a comprehensive set of 79 directional antecedents useful for academicians and practitioners for understanding factors impacting how information technologies are internalized in organizations and supply chains. Research limitations/implications – Empirically testing the proposed directional relationships can be used to confirm their validity and measure the relative strengths of individual or interacting antecedents. The relationships outlined in the SCIM should be tested in a diverse array of industries in order to generalize the model. In addition, the relative strength of the factors should be tested since in different contexts. For more robust understandings, moderating and mediating effects amongst the variables should be identified. Practical implications – Practitioners can use the SCIM as a source for established guidelines for developing strategies for implementing information technologies.

The rice supply chain in Indonesia varies from one region to another and it is difficult to trace movement along the chain from land to customers. This introduces non-transparency and uncertainty in the quantity and quality of rice at every node along the supply chain. The crucial issues of food safety and security, as well as consumer concern and curiosity in buying and consuming foods, increases the need for a traceability system for the rice value chain which can be easily and widely accessed. This paper describes the design framework of an IT (Information Technology)-based traceability system for the rice supply chain on web platforms. The system approach has been followed (where the system requirements are identified based on supply chain characteristics) and then the logical framework for implementing internal and external traceability was modeled using IDEF-0 (Integrated Definition Modeling). This paper further presents an explanation of the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) as an initial step to modeling the data requirements and a model of information exchange between stakeholders that explains the data that must be recorded and forwarded to the next stakeholder.

Despite its continued growth and importance to the economy, the food processing industry in the country remains vulnerable to these problems, which threaten its viability.Motivation for the study: The aim of this study was to investigate supply chain management problems in the food processing industry and their influence on business performance. The study was motivated by the need to use supply chain management practices as a tool to improve business performance in the food processing industry.Research design, approach and method: A questionnaire was distributed to a sample of 303 supply chain professionals working in the food processing industry in Gauteng Province. The collected data were analysed by using descriptive statistics, factor analysis, Pearson correlations and regression analysis.Main findings: Supply chain management problems were identified in seven areas, namely human resource management, technology, facilities, supplier relationship management, customer relationship management, regulatory factors and logistics and transportation. Except for regulatory factors, all supply chain management problems negatively predicted business performance.Contribution or value-add: Practically, the study enables supply chain professionals in the food processing industry to understand the sources of problems and use this information to develop solutions for the improvement of business performance. Theoretically, the study endorses the view that part of the key to resolving business performance complications in the food processing industry involves streamlining supply chain management by resolving its identifiable problems."

It is assumed that if companies across supply chains have visibility of demand, inventory levels, processes, etc., that organizational performance improves. This research explores the antecedents of high levels of supply chain visibility from a resource-based theory perspective across five different external supply chain linkages. We find that the level of visibility across these linkages differs considerably based on various contributing factors which are both technology and non-technology based. Using resource-based theory, we identify those factors that can give a sustainable competitive advantage to a supply chain linkage through a ""distinctive"" or high level of visibility. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we propose a novel product ownership management system (POMS) of RFID-attached products for anti-counterfeits that can be used in the post supply chain. For this purpose, we leverage the idea of Bitcoin's blockchain that anyone can check the proof of possession of balance. With the proposed POMS, a customer can reject the purchase of counterfeits even with genuine RFID tag information, if the seller does not possess their ownership. We have implemented a proof-of-concept experimental system employing a blockchain-based decentralized application platform, Ethereum, and evaluated its cost performance. Results have shown that, typically, the cost of managing the ownership of a product with up to six transfers is less than U.S. 1."

In the green product supply chain, a manufacturer produces green product through developing green technology and a retailer promotes the green product through green marketing. The demand of the green product is uncertain with the mean and the variance as the only known information. After analyzing the utility that a consumer gained from the green product, the problem is then formulated as a distribution-free-based Stackelberg game for a decentralized system under three contracts, i.e., wholesale price-only (WPO), revenue and green marketing cost-sharing (RGMS), and two-part tariff (TPTF) contracts. The analytical results are also proposed to show the effects of the system parameters on supply chain optimal decisions. By comparing with the centralized system, the coordination level for each contract is investigated. Numerical examples and sensitivity analysis with respect to several system parameters are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the contracts under demand uncertainty. The results demonstrate that both RGMS and TPTF contracts are superior to WPO contract. Especially, TPTF contract can always coordinate the supply chain, while RGMS contract can improve the supply chain coordination level only if the revenue and cost sharing coefficients satisfy certain conditions."

The risks of low performing supply chains are detrimental for the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, with potential consequences to future supply in the case of adverse events. For this reason, a study was set up to explore the involvement of developing country manufacturers in the vaccine supply chain over the next decade to determine the areas where innovations could have a positive impact on the supply chain, focusing on the secondary stages of production where formulation, filling and packaging take place. An expert desk review identified eight areas of interest for the vaccine supply chain and informed the development of a survey to assess the relevance of the areas identified. The review also conjectured whether the overall effect of the identified areas is cost-neutral or resulting in net savings to countries. Overall, respondents identified five areas as of highest interest and subsequently an expert working group of representative manufacturers prioritized three of them. Specifically, traceability in the context of global digital health initiatives, stockpiling in the context of addressing vaccine shortages, stock-outs, outbreaks and epidemic prevention, and new packaging technologies are discussed in this report. It is important that vaccine manufacturers be actively engaged in global stakeholders' forums, as equal partners in determining the best ways for improving the vaccine supply chain."

The results of the interviews enabled the author to identify which variables to investigate further through the use of a survey data collection protocol. In the present study, 273 first-tier supply chain members of the second-largest U.S. automotive service-parts logistics operation, who were recently introduced to a new supply chain management technology, were surveyed. Using a structural equation model, nine hypotheses were tested. As hypothesized, an individual's technology trust and interorganizational trust have an effect on perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, which further influence postadoption technology utilization behavior. The results suggest that even in supply chains where usage is mandated, the presence of technology and interorganizational trust can increase individual utilization of new technologies.

The model determines the optimal supply chain strategic and tactical decision variables such as location, capacity and technology of biorefineries, transportation modes, shipments, inventory levels and production and import amounts. The performance of the model is evaluated through a real case study developed in Iran. Comparing the proposed resilient model with its non-resilient counterpart reveals that the proposed model is superior both in cost and GHG emissions reductions.

A successful supply chain optimization project that leveraged technology, engineering principles, and a technician workflow redesign in the setting of a growing health system is described. Summary. With continued rises in medication costs, medication inventory management is increasingly important. Proper management of central pharmacy inventory and floor-stock inventory in automated dispensing cabinets (ADCs) can be challenging. In an effort to improve control of inventory costs in the central pharmacy of a large academic medical center, the pharmacy department implemented a supply chain optimization project in collaboration with the medical center's inhouse team of experts on process improvement and industrial engineering. The project had 2 main components: (1) upgrading and reconfiguring carousel technology within an expanded central pharmacy footprint to generate accurate floor-stock inventory replenishment reports, which resulted in efficiencies within the medication-use system, and (2) implementing a technician workflow redesign and algorithm to right-size the ADC inventory, which decreased inventory stockouts (i.e., incidents of depletion of medication stock) and improved ADC user satisfaction. Conclusion. Through a multifaceted approach to inventory management, the number of stockouts per month was decreased and ADC inventory was optimized, resulting in a one-time inventory cost savings of $220,500."

At present, the terms ""Digital Supply Chain"", ""Supply Chain 4.0"", ""Digital logistics"", and ""Smart logistics"" are widely used in business, and in particular, in the theory and practice of supply chain management (SCM). This demonstrates the relevance of the implementation of Industry 4.0 innovations into the practical activities of manufacturing, trading, and logistics companies, interconnected by networking in the process of delivering products or services to final consumers. In turn, this causes fundamental changes in the structure of supply chains, their business processes and behaviours, making existing approaches to management obsolete. Purpose of the article: The article aims at identifying supply chain development drivers under the conditions of 'Industry 4.0'; determining the effect of DT in the cross-section of strategic and operational changes of supply chain; clarifying the readiness and capacity for DT implementation in the enterprises activity as exemplified by the enterprises operating in Ukraine in various fields of activity. Methods: Stratified proportional sampling was applied as the research method. Ukrainian enterprises of different size, involved in different supply chains, were considered as an object of research. The attitude of the Ukrainian enterprises to the DT implementation is presented, and the results are compared to the relevant research data in other countries. Findings & Value: This study will be valuable to both scientists and practitioners. Scientists will be able to understand the conceptual transformation of SC under the influence of DT. Practitioners will become aware of the following issues: current SCM trends and requirements; DT effects on the strategic and operational levels of the classical model of management; the level of readiness and ability of the Ukrainian enterprises to implement DT in their activities as compared to the enterprises in other countries."

First, literature search and field observations are used to evaluate the business processes in pork supply chain and key traceability information in the system. Then, a mobile solution based on 2D barcode technology for information collection, transformation, and delivery is designed. Finally, a pilot implementation in Jilin Province's Meat and Meat Products Safety Traceability and Regulatory Digitization Project is reported. The traceability system was integrated with the government supervision system to achieve the supervision and traceability of pork from source to table. Implementation results reveal that the system can realize batch-based traceability of pork, which greatly decreases traceability system cost. Additionally, the information verification mechanism between upstream and downstream players, as well as the full participation of consumers, enterprises, and the government, significantly improve the credibility of the traced information."

However, there are still many defects in current model for demand-driven supply chains, e.g. long lead time, low efficiency etc. Therefore, in this study we proposed a new collaborative model with central order processing system (COPS) to optimize current demand-driven garment supply chain and improve multiple supply chain performances. Common and important supply chain collaboration strategies, including resource sharing, information sharing, joint-decision making and profit sharing, were merged into this system. Discrete-event simulation technology was utilized to experiment and evaluate the new collaborative model under different conditions based on a real case in France. Multiple key performance indicators (KPIs) were examined for the whole supply chain and also for individual companies. Based on the simulation experiment results, we found that new proposed collaborative model gain improvements in all examined KPIs. New model with COPS performed better under high workload condition than under low workload condition. It can not only increase overall profit level of the whole supply chain but also individual profit level of each company."

However, the technology uncertainty associated with the supplier's development capability may become a considerable obstacle to new product development projects. In this paper, we further develop an analytical model that has been widely applied in the economics literature and examine two representative supply chain contracts, a revenue-sharing contract and a cost-sharing contract, for new product development through upstream innovation under technology uncertainty. We confirm that the supplier's development capability has a significant impact on contract feasibility. The revenue-sharing contract helps to attain a higher new product quality level and profit for the supply chain. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between a manufacturer and a supplier concerning the performance of the new product development project. Adopting a Nash bargaining model, we analyze the two supply chain contracts under a cooperative relationship in which the manufacturer and supplier cooperatively determine the sharing portion of the revenue or cost. For both contracts, compared with the unilateral relationship, the cooperative relationship leads to a lower manufacturer profit, but a higher new product quality and a higher supply chain profit."

To this end, a multi-directional local search (MDLS) metaheuristic is developed. The proposed method provides a limited set of non-dominated solutions ranging from a purely cost effective solution to a purely environmentally effective one. Each iteration of the MDLS consists in performing local searches from all non-dominated solutions. To do so, a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithm is used. Extensive experiments based on randomly generated instances of various sizes and features are described. Three classic performance measures are used to compare the set of non-dominated solutions obtained by the MDLS algorithm and by directly solving the MILP model with the epsilon-constraint approach.

Due to the complex nature of the biomass value chain, conventional risk mitigation strategies are ineffective in mitigating risks at the management level. More recent approaches, particularly stochastic programming methods, have yielded robust results in addressing technological risks and design uncertainties. However, such approaches are still unable to effectively consider non-quantitative risks such as business risks and regulatory risks. Hence, this study proposes a combined method of an analytical model and stochastic programming approach to prioritize risks and risk mitigation strategies for decision-making purposes. This work presents a novel multiple-criteria decision-making expert system based on fuzzy set theory, which is the Decision and Evaluation-based Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (DEFANP) method. The novel method functions to prioritize risk mitigation strategies within a network relationship of project goals, key components of the biomass industry and industrial stakeholders. As the stochastic risk mitigation counterpart, the fluctuations and uncertainties in operations, transportation, market supply-demand and price are modeled using the Monte Carlo simulation method. From this, risks of implementing biomass polygeneration systems can be mitigated by selecting a strategy that yields the highest analytical indicator while reconciling with the corresponding probabilities of achieving management goals. A palm biomass polygeneration system in Malaysia is presented as case study where the key implementation risks are regulatory risks, financing risks, technology risks, supply chain and feedstock risks, business risks, social and environmental risks."

A number of literatures reveal the research of supply chain management developmenth that has implemented RFID technology. Generally, the method is implemented by combining and informing the journal about cost-benefit analysis model in a company that applies RFID tag technology integratedly from production line, delivery up to management of retailer part. Currently, all links from the entire supply chain need to integrate those different parts and have better controls to get better returns. This integration must offer the ability for the company to have a thorough and transparent insight into its supply chain activities. Intelligent supply chains that are primarily supported by RFID technology can meet these integration needs. By using RFID, a company can benefit from several advantages. One of them is cost reduction and time efficiency. This paper attempts to recommend a model to estimate the benefits of implementing RFID in companies that have an integrated supply chain process. The proposed model is used to find out the value of depreciation and RFID price tag that can provide maximum benefit from RFID implementation. Examples of case studies provide a better understanding of calculation model"

The smart city has always regarded green and low-carbon development as one of the goals, and the carbon emissions of the auto parts industry cannot be ignored, so we should carry out energy conservation and emission reduction. With the rapid development of the domestic auto parts industry, the number of car ownership has increased dramatically, producing more and more CO2 and waste. Facing the pressure of resources, energy, and environment, the effective and circular operation of the auto parts supply chain under the low-carbon transformation is not only a great challenge, but also a development opportunity. Under the background of carbon emission, this paper establishes a decision-making optimization model of the low-carbon supply chain of auto parts based on carbon emission responsibility sharing and resource sharing. This paper analyzes the optimal decision-making behavior and interaction of suppliers, producers, physical retailers, online retailers, demand markets, and recyclers in the auto parts industry, constructs the economic and environmental objective functions of low-carbon supply chain management, applies variational inequality to analyze the optimal conditions of the whole low-carbon supply chain system, and finally carries out simulation calculation. The research shows that the upstream and downstream auto parts enterprises based on low-carbon competition and cooperation can effectively manage the carbon footprint of the whole supply chain through the sharing of responsibilities and resources among enterprises, so as to reduce the overall carbon emissions of the supply chain system."

While all ports fulfill similar functions for the different categories of cargo, the ways in which ports are inserted into supply chains, as well as the ways in which supply chain segments are integrated through technology, management and regulation do differ from one port complex to another. To illustrate our proposition, we discuss and contrast recent developments in the Southern California and Vancouver ports with respect to the regulation, integration and governance of port container trucking. The successful accumulation of value within port-related supply chains is increasingly vulnerable to disruption and inefficiency in port trucking. On the west coast of North America, this is due to both labor related issues as well as issues of asset management. In response, governments, port authorities and operators have taken on a more active role in ensuring that the supply chain has adequate equipment and land to deal with significant congestion-related bottlenecks. These actions represent expanded areas of responsibility beyond traditional notions of port governance."

As inventory inaccuracy contributes to the bullwhip effect, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of inventory inaccuracy on the bullwhip effect in radio-frequency identification (RFID)-enabled supply chains and, in this context, to evaluate supply chain performance because of the RFID technology. Design/methodology/approach: A simulation modeling method based on hierarchical timed colored petri nets is presented to model inventory management in multi-stage serial supply chains subject to inventory inaccuracy for various traditional and information sharing configurations in the presence and absence of RFID. Validation of the method is done by comparing results obtained for the bullwhip effect with published literature results. Findings: The bullwhip effect is increased in RFID-enabled multi-stage serial supply chains subject to inventory inaccuracy. The information sharing supply chain is more sensitive to the impact of inventory inaccuracy. Research limitations/implications: Information sharing involves collaboration in market demand and inventory inaccuracy, whereas RFID is implemented by all echelons. To obtain the full benefits of RFID adoption and collaboration, different collaboration strategies should be investigated. Originality/value: Colored petri nets simulation modeling of the inventory management process is a novel approach to study supply chain dynamics. In the context of inventory errors, information on RFID impact on the dynamic behavior of multi-stage serial supply chains is provided."

Data were collected via an online survey in five European countries. Analysis provided support for the model and showed that consumer confidence is largely determined by consumer beliefs about the trustworthiness of food chain actors. In particular the beliefs about openness, and especially about the openness of food manufacturers, are strongly related to consumer confidence. Some national differences in trust and confidence exist. This instrument is shown to be suitable for monitoring the development of, and changes in, trust across countries over time."
